BOILERPLATE LICENSES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This system was started on the back of the Boilerplate system and though it 
has grown a lot since then I could not have gotten as far as I have without 
their code. Their code: https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate

Their code is licensed MIT but mine is currently All Rights Reserved
for the time being.
