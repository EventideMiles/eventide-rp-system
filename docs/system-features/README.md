# Eventide RP System Features

This section provides detailed documentation on the core features and mechanics of the Eventide Roleplaying System.

## Core Mechanics

### Ability System

The Eventide system is built around five core abilities that determine character capabilities:

- **Acrobatics**: Used for agility, balance, and dexterity-based actions
- **Physical**: Represents raw strength, lifting capacity, and physical power
- **Fortitude**: Determines resilience, stamina, and resistance to physical harm
- **Will**: Governs mental fortitude, determination, and force of personality
- **Wits**: Covers intelligence, perception, and quick thinking

These abilities form the foundation of all checks and actions in the system.

### Dynamic Ability Modification

A key feature of Eventide is the ability to modify character capabilities through multiple systems:

1. **Status Effects**: Temporary modifiers that can change during gameplay
2. **Features**: Permanent character traits that provide lasting modifications
3. **Gear**: Equipment that enhances or restricts abilities while equipped
4. **Hidden Abilities**: GM-controlled modifiers for special scenarios

This creates a highly dynamic system where characters can adapt to situations through preparation and equipment choices.
