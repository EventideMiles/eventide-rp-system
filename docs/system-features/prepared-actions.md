# Prepared Actions

Prepared actions are the art of anticipation—the difference between reacting to a threat and being ready for it before it even arrives. By converting Full Actions into Prepared Actions, you can interrupt enemy moves, counter spells before they're cast, and turn the tide of battle with perfectly timed interventions. This system is tracked manually by the Game Master, creating moments of cinematic tension as declared triggers meet unfolding events.

---

## What Are Prepared Actions?

**The Rule:** A Prepared Action converts one of your Full Actions into a triggered response that can be used during someone else's turn. Each Prepared Action has two essential components:

1. **The Trigger** – What you're watching for (e.g., "when the mage casts a spell")
2. **The Response** – What you'll do about it (e.g., "I throw a rock to disrupt the casting")

When the trigger occurs during another character's turn, you may immediately take your Prepared Action—potentially interrupting their turn before they complete their intended action.

**In Practice:**
> **Elara's Counterspell:** Elara watches an enemy archmage begin weaving complex arcane gestures. On her turn, she declares, "I prepare an action: when that mage casts a spell, I'm going to throw a rock at him to disrupt it." She converts one of her Full Actions into this Prepared Action. When the mage's turn comes and he begins casting, the GM pauses the action. Elara's trigger has occurred—her Prepared Action activates.

**Under the Hood (Technical Note):**
Prepared Actions are NOT tracked automatically by Foundry. This is intentional—they require GM adjudication to determine whether the trigger actually occurred and whether the response is appropriate to the situation. The system gives GMs flexibility to rule on edge cases and dramatic moments without being constrained by automated mechanics.

## Setting Up a Prepared Action

**The Rule:** At any point during your turn, you may convert one or more Full Actions into Prepared Actions. Each Prepared Action can have a different trigger and response, or you can stack multiple Prepared Actions with the same trigger for different contingencies.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Choose a Full Action to Convert:** You have two Full Actions each turn—decide which one(s) you want to dedicate to preparation.
2. **Declare Your Trigger:** Clearly state what you're watching for. Be specific but not overly restrictive—your GM will adjudicate whether the trigger occurs.
3. **Declare Your Response:** Explain what action you'll take when the trigger occurs. This should be something you could normally do with a Full Action (attack, use a combat power, activate an ability, etc.).
4. **Wait for the Moment:** On your turn, you're done—the Prepared Action is now set and will trigger if your condition is met during anyone else's turn (including enemies).

### Trigger Guidelines

**Good Triggers:**
- "When the mage casts a spell"
- "When that archer draws a weapon"
- "When someone moves through the doorway"
- "When an ally within 10 feet is attacked"

**Overly Restrictive Triggers (Avoid):**
- "When the mage casts specifically a fireball spell" (Too specific—might not happen)
- "When the archer looks at me in a threatening way" (Too vague—hard to adjudicate)

**In Practice:**
> **Kael's Ambush Setup:** Kael knows enemies will burst through the north door any moment. He declares, "I convert both my Full Actions into Prepared Actions. First: when anyone comes through that door, I'm casting a lightning bolt. Second: if someone gets past the first attack and moves toward me, I'm attacking with my sword." Now he waits—two triggers set, two responses ready.

> **Game Master's Guide:** When players announce a prepared action, note both their trigger condition ("when the mage casts a spell") and their planned response ("I throw a rock to disrupt it"). When that trigger occurs during someone else's turn, pause the action and adjudicate the attempt. Run the challenge roll between the prepared character and their target, and award the result: a successful preparation interrupts the action and applies damage, while a failed preparation leaves the character to face the consequence. These moments create cinematic tension—savor them!

## How Prepared Actions Resolve

**The Rule:** When your trigger occurs during another character's turn, the action pauses. You and the opponent engage in a Challenge roll—a back-and-forth contest where you both keep rolling until someone fails to beat the previous result.

### The Challenge Process

1. **Trigger Occurs:** The enemy's turn pauses mid-action (they may have already rolled or declared their action)
2. **GM Announces Trigger:** "Your Prepared Action triggers!"
3. **You Roll First:** Roll an appropriate ability (determined by your GM based on your response)
4. **Opponent Responds:** The opponent rolls their primary ability for the action they're attempting
5. **Continue Until Failure:** You alternate rolling until one of you fails to beat the previous result
6. **Determine Outcome:**
   - **If You Win:** Your response executes successfully, interrupting their action
   - **If They Win:** Your Prepared Action is lost, and their action completes

### What Happens on Success

When you win the challenge, your response takes effect immediately:

- **Interrupting Actions:** The enemy loses the action they were attempting (e.g., a spell fizzles, an attack is deflected)
- **Applying Effects:** If your response deals damage or applies effects, resolve them now
- **Narrative Impact:** Describe the interruption dramatically—a rock cracks the mage's concentration, a bolt deflects the arrow, your sword slashes the charging goblin

### What Happens on Failure

When you lose the challenge:

- **Prepared Action Lost:** You've spent the Full Action with no effect
- **Enemy Continues:** Their action resolves normally—they get to press their action card now and see what their action does
- **You're Exposed:** You're now left dealing with the consequences of their completed action

**Opponent Reactions to Prepared Actions:**

Opponents can use their Reaction to respond to your Prepared Action, creating a back-and-forth contest similar to counterspelling.

- **If the opponent wins the challenge:** They are not interrupted. They must now hit their action card and see how it fares against your AC.
- **If the opponent loses the challenge:** They are interrupted. They don't make an attack roll—they simply lose that specific action (not action points). They still have their remaining actions to use.

**In Practice:**
> **Elara's Counterspell Resolves:** The enemy mage begins casting a fireball. The GM pauses: "Elara, your Prepared Action triggers! What do you do?" She explains: "I throw a rock to disrupt him." The GM tells her to roll Acrobatics (for the throw). She rolls 18. The mage rolls Will to maintain concentration: 16. Elara wins! The rock strikes the mage's hand, the spell fizzles, and the mage loses their action for this turn. The party cheers—Elara's preparation saved them all.

> **Seraphina's Failed Interrupt:** Seraphina had prepared to attack an archer when they drew a weapon. The trigger occurs, and they roll a Challenge. Seraphina rolls 14 with her sword attack. The archer rolls 17 on their Wits to react. Seraphina loses—her Prepared Action is consumed, and the archer is not interrupted. The archer now uses the action card to fire the arrow. If they hit, the arrow flies at her ally. If they miss, the shot goes wild. She tried, but the archer was too fast.

**Under the Hood (Technical Note):**
The Challenge system is central to Prepared Actions. Unlike Reactions (which happen AFTER an effect), Prepared Actions can interrupt BEFORE the effect completes. This makes them powerful but requires careful GM adjudication. The back-and-forth rolling creates dramatic tension as skill clashes against skill. Remember: whoever loses the Challenge doesn't necessarily suffer any penalty beyond losing the Prepared Action—their action just continues normally. The penalty is purely the wasted opportunity.

## Multiple Prepared Actions

**The Rule:** You may convert multiple Full Actions into Prepared Actions on the same turn. Each Prepared Action operates independently with its own trigger and response. This allows for layered tactics—covering multiple threats or setting up contingencies based on how the battle unfolds.

### Stacking Strategies

**Trigger Stacking:** Set multiple Prepared Actions with different triggers to cover various scenarios
- "When someone comes through the door, I attack with lightning"
- "If someone casts a spell, I counterspell"
- "If someone attacks my ally, I defend them"

**Response Stacking:** Set multiple Prepared Actions with the same trigger but different responses
- "When the mage casts a spell, I throw a rock" (Action 1)
- "When the mage casts a spell, I also ready my shield to block" (Action 2)

**Sequential Stacking:** Set triggers in a logical sequence
- "When the goblin charges, I attack it" (Action 1)
- "If my first attack fails to stop it, I'll attack again" (Action 2)

**In Practice:**
> **Grim's Layered Defense:** Grim knows a tough fight is coming. He converts both Full Actions into Prepared Actions. "First, when anyone charges us, I'll intercept with my shield. Second, if someone casts a spell, I'll throw my axe at them." Now he's covered both melee and magical threats. The GM notes both triggers—when either occurs, the corresponding Prepared Action activates.

---

## Prepared Action Examples

### Example 1: The Counterspell

**Situation:** An enemy sorcerer is preparing to cast a devastating spell on the party.

**Player's Preparation:**
- "I convert one Full Action into a Prepared Action. When that sorcerer casts a spell, I'm going to counterspell it."

**Trigger Occurs:**
- The sorcerer's turn begins. The GM announces, "The sorcerer begins casting—he's weaving dark energy!"

**Challenge Roll:**
- Player rolls Will: 19 (counterspell attempt)
- Sorcerer rolls Will: 16 (maintaining concentration)
- **Result:** Player wins

**Outcome:**
- The sorcerer's spell fizzles and is lost for this turn
- The sorcerer wastes their action
- The party is safe for now

---

### Example 2: The Doorway Ambush

**Situation:** The party knows enemies will breach through a narrow doorway soon.

**Player's Preparation:**
- "I convert both Full Actions into Prepared Actions. When anyone comes through that door, I'll hit them with my sword. If a second person comes through, I'll hit them too."

**Trigger Occurs:**
- The GM announces, "An ogre crashes through the door!"

**Challenge Roll:**
- Player rolls Physical: 18 (sword attack)
- Ogre rolls Physical: 15 (resisting)
- **Result:** Player wins

**Outcome:**
- The sword strike hits the ogre, dealing damage
- The ogre's charge is interrupted mid-step
- The player's second Prepared Action remains available for another intruder

---

### Example 3: The Failed Preparation

**Situation:** A ranger is aiming at the party's healer.

**Player's Preparation:**
- "I convert one Full Action into a Prepared Action. When that ranger fires an arrow at our healer, I'll deflect it with my shield."

**Trigger Occurs:**
- The ranger's turn begins. The GM announces, "The ranger draws their bow and aims at the healer!"

**Challenge Roll:**
- Player rolls Acrobatics: 12 (shield deflection attempt)
- Ranger rolls Wits: 17 (aiming skill)
- **Result:** Player loses

**Outcome:**
- The Prepared Action is consumed with no effect
- The arrow strikes the healer, dealing damage
- The player has wasted their Full Action and exposed their healer

---

### Example 4: The Hazard Reaction

**Situation:** An enemy is throwing molotov cocktails at the party.

**Player's Preparation:**
- "I convert one Full Action into a Prepared Action. When someone throws a molotov, I'll kick it away from us."

**Trigger Occurs:**
- The enemy's turn begins. The GM announces, "The goblin lights a molotov and hurls it toward your group!"

**Challenge Roll:**
- Player rolls Acrobatics: 16 (kick attempt)
- Goblin rolls Physical: 13 (throw accuracy)
- **Result:** Player wins

**Outcome:**
- The player kicks the molotov away
- The molotov lands in an empty square and ignites
- The party avoids the fire damage and burning status effect

> **Note:** If the Prepared Action challenge succeeds, the molotov is kicked away and takes no damage. If the Prepared Action challenge fails, the molotov impacts and deals damage. The prepared character cannot "take damage from the initial throw" if their Prepared Action succeeds—the whole point is to interrupt BEFORE the throw completes.

## Prepared Actions vs. Reactions

**The Rule:** It's crucial to understand the difference between Prepared Actions and Reactions, as they serve different tactical purposes.

### Prepared Actions
- **Setup:** Declare on YOUR turn, activate on SOMEONE ELSE'S turn
- **Timing:** Can interrupt BEFORE an action completes
- **Trigger:** Specific condition you declare in advance
- **Response:** Action you specify when setting up the preparation
- **Cost:** Converts a Full Action
- **Outcome:** Challenge roll determines if you interrupt successfully

### Reactions

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Feature | Prepared Action | Reaction |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Setup | On YOUR turn | Start combat with +1 per turn |
| Timing | Interrupts BEFORE effect | Happens AFTER effect |
| Trigger | Specific condition declared in advance | Any threat to yourself |
| Cost | Converts Full Action | Free resource, replenishes |
| Resolution | Challenge roll | Challenge roll |
| Opponent can counter | Yes, with their Reaction | Yes, with another Reaction |

- **Setup:** Start each combat with one, gain one each turn
- **Timing:** Happens AFTER an effect has already impacted you
- **Trigger:** Any threat to yourself (within reason)
- **Response:** Appropriate response to the specific threat
- **Cost:** Free resource that replensishes each turn (not converted from other actions)
- **Outcome:** Challenge roll determines if you can remove/mitigate the effect

**In Practice:**
> **Prepared Action:** "When the mage casts a spell, I'll throw a rock to stop it." (Preemptive interruption)
>
> **Reaction:** "The mage's spell hit me and charmed me. I'm using my Reaction to shake off the charm." (Reactive mitigation)

> **Game Master's Guide:** Remember that Reactions happen AFTER the effect—you've already taken damage or been affected. Prepared Actions happen BEFORE the effect completes—you can prevent it from happening. Both use Challenge rolls, but their tactical roles are different. Encourage players to think about which one fits the situation: are you trying to stop something before it happens (Prepared Action), or recover from something that already happened (Reaction)?

## GM Adjudication Guidelines

**The Rule:** As the Game Master, you have complete discretion in adjudicating Prepared Actions. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing you to make rulings that serve the story and the table's enjoyment. Here are guidelines to help you adjudicate consistently and fairly.

### Determining Whether Triggers Occur

**Clear Triggers:** If the player's trigger clearly occurs (e.g., "when the mage casts a spell" and the mage casts a spell), activate the Prepared Action immediately.

**Ambiguous Triggers:** If there's doubt about whether the trigger occurred, use your judgment:
- Favor the player slightly—their preparation should feel meaningful
- Don't be too permissive—triggers should be reasonably specific, not vague attempts to get free actions
- Consider narrative context: Does the trigger match the spirit of what the player intended?

**Edge Cases:** You may encounter unusual trigger declarations:
- "When anyone hostile makes eye contact with me" → Probably too vague—ask for clarification
- "When someone uses fire magic" → Clear and reasonable
- "When the GM laughs evilly" → Fun, but not a valid trigger for combat—rule it out

### Choosing Abilities for Challenge Rolls

When determining which ability each side rolls in the Challenge, consider:

**Player's Ability:** Base it on their response
- Throwing a rock → Acrobatics (precision throwing)
- Sword attack → Physical (melee combat)
- Counterspell → Will (magical resistance)
- Shield deflection → Acrobatics (reflexes) or Physical (strength)

**Opponent's Ability:** Use their primary ability for the action they're attempting
- Casting a spell → Will
- Firing a bow → Wits or Acrobatics
- Charging with a weapon → Physical
- Using psychic powers → Will

### Managing Multiple Prepared Actions

When a player has multiple Prepared Actions set:

- Track all triggers and responses clearly
- Activate the appropriate one when its trigger occurs
- Don't allow players to retroactively change triggers once set
- Consider whether one Prepared Action's resolution affects another's validity (e.g., if the first kills the target, the second may no longer have a valid target)

### Narrative Flavor

Prepared Actions are perfect for dramatic storytelling:

- Describe the moment of anticipation: "You watch the mage carefully, muscles tensed, waiting for the perfect moment..."
- Build tension when the trigger occurs: "The sorcerer raises their hands, arcane energy crackling between their fingers..."
- Celebrate successful interruptions: "Your rock finds its mark! The sorcerer gasps as their concentration shatters, the spell dissipating harmlessly!"
- Make failed preparations feel meaningful: "Your shield is too slow—the arrow slips past and finds its mark. You tried, but the enemy was simply faster."

**In Practice:**
> **GM Marcus's Ruling:** The player declared, "When someone attacks our healer, I'll intercept." During the enemy's turn, an archer fires an arrow at the healer. Marcus rules that this trigger clearly occurs—the arrow is literally in flight toward the healer. He activates the Prepared Action and calls for Challenge rolls. The player rolls 18, the archer rolls 14. The player wins—their character leaps in front of the arrow, taking the hit themselves and protecting the healer. Marcus describes this heroically: "Without hesitation, you throw yourself between the arrow and your friend. The shaft buries itself in your shoulder, but your healer is safe!"

**Under the Hood (Technical Note):**
The flexibility of Prepared Actions is a feature, not a bug. The system trusts GMs to make fair, fun rulings rather than constraining them with rigid rules. If you find yourself constantly struggling to adjudicate a particular type of trigger, consider having a conversation with your group about what triggers are reasonable—establishing table conventions can help everyone be on the same page.

## Advanced Tactics

### Simultaneous Triggers

When multiple Prepared Actions trigger at the same time:

1. **Process in initiative order** – Characters with higher initiative act first
2. **Each Prepared Action resolves independently** – Successes and failures don't cascade
3. **Target validity check** – If a later Prepared Action's target is already affected by an earlier one (e.g., dead or unconscious), the GM may rule it invalid
4. **Unused Prepared Actions remain available** – Prepared Actions that don't trigger stay available for other opportunities

**In Practice:**
> **Multiple Counterspells:** Three characters all prepared actions to counterspell the enemy mage. When the mage casts a spell, the GM processes them in initiative order. The first character (highest initiative) wins their Challenge and interrupts the spell. The second and third characters' Prepared Actions don't trigger—the spell is already stopped. Their Full Actions are wasted, but the threat is neutralized.

> **Partial Success:** Two characters prepare to attack when enemies burst through a door. When an ogre crashes through, the first character (higher initiative) succeeds and deals heavy damage. The ogre survives. The second character's Prepared Action now triggers—since the ogre is still alive and in range, they can also attack. Both Prepared Actions activate successfully.

### The Interrupt Chain

Multiple characters can have Prepared Actions with overlapping triggers. When this happens, determine the order of activation:

- Characters with higher initiative act first
- If tied, GM decides or roll off
- Each character's Prepared Action resolves independently—successes and failures don't cascade

**In Practice:**
> **Multiple Counterspells:** Three characters all prepared actions to counterspell the enemy mage. When the mage casts a spell, the GM processes them in initiative order. The first character (highest initiative) wins their Challenge and interrupts the spell. The second and third characters' Prepared Actions don't trigger—the spell is already stopped. Their Full Actions are wasted, but the threat is neutralized.

### The Trigger Cascade

One Prepared Action's resolution can create new triggers for other Prepared Actions:

**In Practice:**
> **Cascading Prepared Actions:** Character A prepares to attack when someone opens the door. Character B prepares to heal whoever gets hurt in the doorway fight. When an enemy opens the door, Character A's Prepared Action triggers and attacks successfully. The enemy survives and counterattacks, hurting Character A. Now Character B's Prepared Action triggers, healing Character A. Both Prepared Actions activate in sequence, creating a dynamic combat exchange.

### The Failed Preparation Recovery

When a Prepared Action fails, the character has lost their Full Action with no effect. However, they can still act normally on their next turn—losing a Prepared Action doesn't create any ongoing penalties. The only loss is the opportunity cost of the spent Full Action.

---

## Summary: The Art of Preparation

Prepared Actions are a powerful tactical tool that rewards foresight and clever planning. By converting Full Actions into triggered responses, you can:

- **Interrupt enemy actions before they complete**
- **Protect allies from incoming threats**
- **Set up layered defenses against multiple scenarios**
- **Create moments of dramatic tension and cinematic storytelling**

The system is intentionally flexible, giving GMs discretion to adjudicate unusual situations and edge cases. This flexibility allows every table to develop their own style—some groups may favor highly specific triggers and meticulous planning, while others may prefer loose triggers and improvisational rulings.

Remember: Prepared Actions are tracked manually. Foundry will flag critical hits and misses, but it won't track your preparations. This is by design—the action economy is yours to manage, creating a richer, more engaging combat experience where every choice matters and every action has consequences.

Anticipate, declare, and wait. When the moment comes, be ready.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can a Prepared Action trigger on my own turn?**
A: No, Prepared Actions only trigger during OTHER characters' turns. They cannot activate on your own turn—if you want to do something on your turn, simply use a Full Action.

**Q: What if my Prepared Action target moves out of range before the trigger occurs?**
A: GM discretion—usually the Prepared Action is wasted. However, some GMs may allow you to adjust your response or trigger if the narrative supports it.

**Q: Can I have the same trigger for multiple Prepared Actions?**
A: Yes, but only the first one to trigger will activate. Once a trigger occurs, all Prepared Actions with that trigger become spent (whether they activated or not).

**Q: Do Prepared Actions expire?**
A: Yes, they last until your next turn unless triggered. If your next turn arrives and the trigger never occurred, your Prepared Action is wasted.

**Q: Can I change my Prepared Action after I've declared it?**
A: No, once declared, a Prepared Action cannot be changed. Choose your triggers and responses carefully!

**Q: What happens if my Prepared Action trigger occurs but I'm unable to respond?**
A: If you're unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to act when your trigger occurs, the Prepared Action is wasted.

**Q: Can I use a Prepared Action to attack someone who's already dead?**
A: No—if your target is already dead or unconscious when your trigger occurs, the GM will rule the Prepared Action invalid and it is wasted.

**Q: Can I use a Prepared Action to counter another Prepared Action?**
A: No, Prepared Actions cannot counter other Prepared Actions. However, Reactions can be used to counter Prepared Actions (see [Opponent Reactions](#prepared-actions-vs-reactions)).
