# Cleanse Actions

The battlefield is a dangerous place, and even the mightiest heroes find themselves weighed down by wounds, poisons, and magical afflictions. Cleanse Actions are your lifeline—the means by which you shake off harmful effects and maintain your combat effectiveness when the odds turn against you.

---

## The Rule

Cleanse Actions are your defense against harmful status effects. Each turn, you gain one free Cleanse Action. If you need more, you may convert Full Actions into additional Cleanse Actions. To cleanse an effect, roll an appropriate ability against the Armor Class (AC) of the character or creature that created the effect.

---

## How Cleanse Actions Work

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

When a harmful effect plagues you, you have two options:

- **Use your Cleanse Action on your turn** – Roll against the effect creator's static AC to remove the effect
- **Use your Reaction immediately** – Challenge the effect with back-and-forth rolling (see [Reaction Challenges](#when-to-use-cleanse-vs-reaction-challenges))

### Step 2: Select the Right Ability

Choose an ability appropriate to resisting the effect:

| Effect Type | Recommended Ability | Example |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| Physical wounds, arrows, poisons | **Physical** | Removing an arrow, shaking off a toxin |
| Mental assaults, charms, domination | **Will** | Resisting mind control, breaking a curse |
| Maneuver-based effects, grapples | **Acrobatics** | Escaping a net, slipping free from bindings |
| Endurance-based afflictions | **Fortitude** | Withstanding disease, overcoming fatigue |

### Step 3: Roll Against the Creator's AC

Roll your chosen ability against the AC of the character or creature that created the effect. The AC formula is:

**AC = 11 + Relevant Stat + Any AC-Specific Bonuses**

> **Important:** You roll against a **static AC**, not against an opponent's actual roll. This is not a challenge roll—you're testing yourself against a fixed difficulty, not engaging in a back-and-forth contest.

### Step 4: Resolve the Outcome

- **If you succeed:** The effect is immediately removed. You're free of its burden and can continue fighting at full effectiveness.
- **If you fail:** The effect lingers, and you've spent your Cleanse Action. You'll need to try again on a future turn or find another way to deal with it.

## In Practice

> **Varrick's Desperate Recovery:** Varrick has an arrow lodged in his leg from a skilled elven archer. The arrow has been poisoning him, reducing his combat effectiveness. On his turn, he uses his Cleanse Action, rolling Physical against the archer's AC (which is based on the archer's Acrobatics of 5, giving an AC of 16). He rolls a 17—success! The arrow is dislodged, and the poison ceases to afflict him. Now he can use his Full Actions without the penalty.
>
> **Seraphina's Mental Struggle:** Seraphina has been charmed by a sorcerer's enchantment. On her turn, she uses her Cleanse Action, rolling Will against the sorcerer's AC (based on Will of 6, giving AC 17). She rolls a 14—failure. The charm lingers, and she must spend another Cleanse Action next turn to try again. Meanwhile, the sorcerer continues to manipulate her actions.
> **Game Master's Guide:** When a character uses a Cleanse action to remove a harmful effect, guide the roll appropriately. They'll roll against the AC of the effect's creator—use the stat tied to that character (Physical for an archer's arrow, Will for a mental assault, etc.). If they succeed, remove the status and celebrate their recovery. If they fail, the effect lingers and the battle continues against them. Cleanse actions represent the struggle to shake off wounds and ailments—make each attempt feel significant.

## When to Use Cleanse vs Reaction Challenges

The choice between Cleanse Actions and Reaction Challenges is a tactical decision with important trade-offs.

### Use Cleanse Actions When

- **You can afford to wait** – The effect isn't immediately catastrophic
- **You want predictable outcomes** – Rolling against static AC reduces variance
- **You're conserving your Reaction** – Save your Reaction for more urgent threats
- **The effect is already established** – You're dealing with something that's already affecting you

### Use Reaction Challenges When

- **You need immediate response** – The effect could cause catastrophic harm if left unchecked
- **You want to prevent the effect entirely** – Reactions happen AFTER the effect, but can still mitigate it
- **You're willing to risk more for greater reward** – Challenge rolls are back-and-forth contests with higher stakes
- **The effect is about to happen** – You're responding to an incoming threat

> **Example:** If you're targeted by a mind control spell, using your Reaction to challenge it immediately might prevent you from being forced to attack your allies. If you wait until your turn to use a Cleanse Action, you might have already done something regrettable under the spell's influence.

## Cleanse Actions and the Action Economy

Cleanse Actions are a limited resource that must be managed carefully alongside your other actions.

### Your Cleanse Action Pool

Each turn, you gain:

- **1 Free Cleanse Action** – Your baseline defense against harmful effects
- **Additional Cleanse Actions** – Convert Full Actions if you need more (at the cost of offensive capability)

### Conversion Rules

You may convert any number of Full Actions into Cleanse Actions:

- **1 Full Action → 1 Cleanse Action**
- **2 Full Actions → 2 Cleanse Actions** (if you're heavily afflicted)

> **Strategic Consideration:** Converting Full Actions into Cleanse Actions reduces your offensive output. Sometimes it's worth it to shake off a debilitating effect, but other times you're better off fighting through the penalty and using your Full Actions to end the fight quickly.

### What Cleanse Actions Cannot Do

- **Cannot be converted into recovery** – Unlike Full Actions, Move Actions, and Reactions, Cleanse Actions cannot be used to restore HP or Power
- **Cannot be used during a Push** – If you declare a Push, you sacrifice your Cleanse Action along with your Move and Reaction
- **Cannot be banked** – Unused Cleanse Actions are lost at the end of your turn

---

## Critical Cleanses

When you roll a natural 20 (or within your critical threshold) on a Cleanse Action, you gain an **immediate bonus Full Action**:

- **On Your Turn:** Use it right away as a third Full Action
- **On an Enemy's Turn:** Their turn pauses, and you take your bonus Full Action before they continue

> **Design Philosophy:** Critical hits should feel rewarding no matter what caused them. A critical cleanse represents a moment of breakthrough—you shake off the effect so decisively that you surge forward with renewed vigor.

---

## Under the Hood (Technical Note)

Cleanse actions are not challenge rolls—you roll against a static AC, not against an opponent's actual roll. This design choice was intentional to reduce luck's impact on recovery; effects are meant to slightly linger and wear characters down over time, so removing them requires deliberate effort.

Some GMs prefer making cleanse actions into challenge rolls (both sides rolling) for more dramatic back-and-forth contests. That's a valid variation if you prefer higher variance, but keep in mind it means luck becomes a factor on BOTH sides of the equation.

### The "Agile Armor" Quirk

You may notice that agile opponents (those with high Acrobatics) are harder to cleanse effects from. For example, if an archer has armor that gives +1 AC to Acrobatics, attempts to remove their arrows become 1 point more difficult. This is intentional—the system was designed to make effects slightly less likely to be removed, representing the gradual wearing down of combatants over time.

## Common Cleanse Scenarios

### Removing Physical Afflictions

> **Scenario:** You've been hit by a poisoned arrow. The poison deals damage each turn and reduces your Physical by 2.
> **Solution:** Use your Cleanse Action to roll Physical against the archer's AC. If you succeed, the poison is purged from your system and the penalty is removed.

### Breaking Mental Control

> **Scenario:** A sorcerer has charmed you, forcing you to attack your allies on their turn.
> **Solution:** Use your Cleanse Action to roll Will against the sorcerer's AC. If you succeed, the charm is broken and you regain control of your actions. If you fail, you'll need to try again next turn—or use your Reaction immediately to challenge the charm before it takes effect.

### Escaping Environmental Effects

> **Scenario:** You've fallen into a pit of magical tar that slows your movement and deals ongoing damage.
> **Solution:** Use your Cleanse Action to roll Acrobatics against the tar's creator (if it has one) or a GM-determined AC. If you succeed, you pull yourself free and can move normally again.

### Shaking Off Multiple Effects

> **Scenario:** You're afflicted by three different status effects: poison, fear, and a burning condition.
> **Solution:** You have one free Cleanse Action, so you can attempt to remove one effect. Choose the most debilitating one first. If you need to remove all three, you'll need to convert two Full Actions into additional Cleanse Actions—leaving you with no offensive actions this turn. Sometimes it's better to fight through the effects and end the combat quickly.

## GM Tips for Running Cleanse Actions

1. **Know the ACs:** Keep track of your NPCs' ACs in each relevant stat so you can quickly determine cleanse difficulties.
2. **Make it dramatic:** Describe the struggle to shake off effects. A failed cleanse isn't just a missed roll—it's a moment of weakness that the enemy can exploit.
3. **Balance the pace:** If players are spending too many actions cleansing, consider reducing the frequency of status effects. If they're never cleansing, make effects more threatening.
4. **Reward clever play:** If a player describes a creative way to remove an effect (e.g., using water to wash away acid), consider giving them advantage on the cleanse roll.
5. **Track the action economy:** Remember that each cleanse attempt costs an action. Players who are constantly cleansing are dealing less damage—this is intentional, but be aware of how it affects encounter pacing.

## Summary

Cleanse Actions are your primary defense against harmful effects. Each turn, you gain one free Cleanse Action, and you can convert Full Actions into additional cleanses if needed. Roll an appropriate ability against the effect creator's AC to remove the affliction. Choose between Cleanse Actions (predictable, on your turn) and Reaction Challenges (immediate, higher variance) based on the tactical situation. Critical cleanses grant bonus Full Actions, creating moments of breakthrough and renewed vigor. Manage your cleanse resources wisely—sometimes it's better to fight through an effect and end the fight quickly, while other times removing the affliction is the key to victory.
