# Modern Game Flow

Since I wrote most of the documentation in [docs](/docs/) its notable that many of the systems have grown and evolved. This is the new guide for how to prepare and run in the Eventide RP System.

## Preparing

The flow I've been using for preparing is, pretty much, confined to action cards. I've found that my players do not like things such as tracking ammo or items, and that using the gear system is just not something they particularly enjoy. To that end, I would **highly** suggest making Action Cards the may method of interacting with the players.

### The Caveat

The nice bit about action cards? Is that they can be built from almost any other type of item. So, if you've built a 'sword' that has an attack in it? You can drag it right into the actions card tab in a character sheet and it will make an action card for you or you can open an existing action card and put it in the section where you'd typically put the combat power. You will have to have a roll defined on it for it to work correctly, but this is a great way to put swords into an attack.

## Helping Players Prepare

My suggestion would be to start with the character creation rules I've defined in [ERPS Ruleset Character Creation](../erps-ruleset/erps-ruleset-character-creation.md) and proceed from there. You may find you want to tweak the numbers, but really the best way to know is to run a session, test and see if its the feel you want, and then tweak things as you need to.

## Preparing NPCs

I'd suggest following the same rules for players with the following exceptions:

1. If its meant to be a difficult encounter don't be afraid to use some enemies that are above the player's level.
2. Do not be afraid to run the players out of resolve: just be ready to deal with the consequences of the [forge ahead](#forge-ahead) philosophy if you do. Remember, you're in charge, if you can come up with a reason for WHY an encounter ends early and you don't want to continue? Do it. If you can come up with a reason for why an enemy's performance might drop? Use it.

## Forge Ahead

The "forge ahead" philosophy refers to the fact that your action shouldn't stop just because your players failed an action.
