# Eventide RP System Guide for Game Masters

This comprehensive guide provides Game Masters with everything needed to run engaging and dynamic games using the Eventide Roleplaying System in Foundry VTT.

## Getting Started as a GM

### System Philosophy

Eventide RP is designed around several core principles that shape how you'll run games:

- **Dynamic Character Modification**: Characters change through status effects, gear, and transformations
- **Narrative-Driven Mechanics**: System supports story over rigid rules
- **Player Agency**: Multiple viable approaches to challenges
- **GM Flexibility**: Tools that adapt to your storytelling style
- **Streamlined Complexity**: Depth without overwhelming detail

### Essential First Steps

1. **Complete Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md)
2. **Configure Settings**: Review [System Settings](../system-features/settings.md) for your campaign
3. **Import Macros**: Get the ERPS Macros from the compendium
4. **Create Test Content**: Use creators to make sample NPCs, gear, and effects
5. **Practice Core Mechanics**: Familiarize yourself with combat and status systems

## Creating and Managing NPCs

### NPC Actor Types

#### **Character vs NPC Types**

- **Character Type**: Use for important, recurring NPCs who need individual tracking

- **Best Practice**: Default to NPC type unless the character needs persistent individual state

#### **NPC Creation Workflow**

1. **Create Actor**: Choose "NPC" type for most characters
2. **Set Core Abilities**: Assign values based on the NPC's role and competence
3. **Add Features**: Create permanent traits that reflect background and training
4. **Equip Gear**: Use Gear Creator to make appropriate equipment
5. **Prepare Status Effects**: Create effects you might apply to players in advance
6. **Add Combat Powers**: Give NPCs interesting special abilities

### Ability Score Guidelines
