# Eventide RP System Guide for Game Masters

This comprehensive guide provides Game Masters with everything needed to run engaging and dynamic games using the Eventide Roleplaying System in Foundry VTT.

## Getting Started as a GM

### System Philosophy

Eventide RP is designed around several core principles that shape how you'll run games:

- **Dynamic Character Modification**: Characters change through status effects, gear, and transformations
- **Narrative-Driven Mechanics**: System supports story over rigid rules
- **Player Agency**: Multiple viable approaches to challenges
- **GM Flexibility**: Tools that adapt to your storytelling style
- **Streamlined Complexity**: Depth without overwhelming detail

### Essential First Steps

1. **Complete Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md)
