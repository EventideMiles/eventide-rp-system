# Core Rules
## How to Play the Eventide RP System

Welcome to the Eventide RP System! This guide will teach you everything you need to know to create characters and play the game. Whether you're completely new to tabletop RPGs or coming from other systems, you'll find ERPS's approach both familiar and refreshingly different.

## What Makes ERPS Different?

Most RPGs give you a character sheet with fixed numbers that rarely change. ERPS is built around a simple but powerful idea: **your character's capabilities change based on what they're doing and what they have with them.**

A scholar with lockpicks isn't just "a scholar" - they're a scholar *with the right tools for the job*. A city-raised character isn't just good at everything - they excel when their urban knowledge actually matters. This creates characters that feel real and dynamic, where your background, gear, and current situation all matter.

## The Five Abilities

Every character in ERPS has five core abilities that define what they can do:

### Acrobatics
Your agility, balance, and finesse. Use Acrobatics for:
- **Stealth and sneaking** past guards
- **Climbing** walls or escaping through windows  
- **Ranged combat** with bows or thrown weapons
- **Delicate tasks** like picking locks or disarming traps
- **Balance and coordination** when crossing narrow ledges

### Physical
Your raw strength and physical prowess. Use Physical for:
- **Melee combat** with most weapons
- **Breaking down doors** or forcing your way through
- **Lifting heavy objects** or carrying unconscious allies
- **Athletics** like swimming or jumping
- **Intimidation** through physical presence

### Fortitude
Your resilience, stamina, and toughness. Use Fortitude for:
- **Resisting poison** or disease
- **Endurance tasks** like long-distance travel
- **Surviving harsh environments** (cold, heat, starvation)
- **Recovering from injuries** or exhaustion
- **Withstanding mental pressure** in some situations

*Fortitude also determines your **Resolve** (health/stamina): Fortitude + 10*

### Will
Your mental strength, magical aptitude, and force of personality. Use Will for:
- **Magic and supernatural abilities** (if your campaign includes them)
- **Leadership** and inspiring others
- **Resisting mental effects** like fear or charm
- **Social situations** requiring authority or persuasion
- **Activating magical items** or combat powers

*Will also determines your **Power** (magical energy): Will + 5*

### Wits
Your intelligence, perception, and tactical thinking. Use Wits for:
- **Noticing details** and spotting hidden things
- **Solving puzzles** and understanding complex problems
- **Remembering information** about history, lore, or people
- **Tactical planning** in combat or complex situations
- **Understanding social situations** and reading people

## How Rolls Work

When you want to do something with an uncertain outcome, you make a roll:

**Roll 1d20 + your relevant ability score**

That's it! No complicated modifiers to calculate - just add your ability score directly to the d20 result.

### Difficulty Classes

Your Game Master (GM) sets a target number called a Difficulty Class (DC). If your total meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed!

- **DC 15**: Trivial tasks (routine activities with minimal risk)
- **DC 20**: Easy challenges (simple tasks requiring basic competence)
- **DC 25**: Moderate challenges (standard difficulties requiring focus)
- **DC 30**: Hard tasks (difficult challenges requiring skill and preparation)
- **DC 35**: Very Hard (expert-level challenges requiring exceptional ability)
- **DC 40**: Extreme feats (legendary achievements at the edge of possibility)
- **DC 45**: Mythic challenges (epic feats requiring mastery)
- **DC 50+**: Divine tasks (godlike achievements requiring extraordinary circumstances)

The beauty of this scale is that it grows with your character. What starts as an impossible challenge (DC 40) for a new character becomes achievable for an experienced adventurer with the right training and equipment.

### Sweet Spot Guidelines for GMs

While the DC scale remains constant, character capabilities grow significantly. Use these guidelines to maintain appropriate challenge levels:

**Levels 1-5 (Starting Characters)**
- Sweet Spot Challenge: DC 25 (50-70% success rate)
- Difficult Challenge: DC 30-35
- Near Impossible: DC 40+

**Levels 6-10 (Experienced Adventurers)**  
- Sweet Spot Challenge: DC 30 (50-70% success rate)
- Difficult Challenge: DC 35-40
- Near Impossible: DC 45+

**Levels 11-15 (Veteran Adventurers)**
- Sweet Spot Challenge: DC 35 (50-70% success rate)  
- Difficult Challenge: DC 40-45
- Near Impossible: DC 50+

**Levels 16-20 (Legendary Heroes)**
- Sweet Spot Challenge: DC 40 (50-70% success rate)
- Difficult Challenge: DC 45-50  
- Near Impossible: DC 55+

Remember: Lower DCs become trivial as intended - this represents character growth and mastery!

### Example
Sarah's character has Acrobatics 14 and wants to sneak past a guard. The GM decides this is a moderate challenge (DC 25). Sarah rolls a d20 and gets 12. Her total is 12 + 14 = 26, which beats the DC 25 - she successfully sneaks past!

## What Changes Your Abilities?

Here's where ERPS gets interesting. Your base ability scores are just the starting point. Several things can modify them:

### Features (Permanent Traits)
Features represent your character's background, training, and inherent abilities. They can:
- **Add permanent bonuses** to your abilities
- **Give you special rolls** for specific situations
- **Do both**

**Example**: Military Training might give you +2 Physical and +2 Acrobatics (from conditioning), *plus* let you make Wits rolls with advantage for tactical analysis in combat situations.

## Common Features

Once per session, you may become completely immune to all damage for one full round while protecting others.
**Stat Changes**: +3 points distributed among any abilities, +5 maximum health
**Specialty Roll**: Fortitude with advantage for protection, plus complete damage immunity once per session

### GM Guidance: Creating Balanced Features

#### Regular Feature Guidelines

**Stat Distribution:**
- **Single Focus**: +2 to one ability (recommended for most features, +2 total)
- **Dual Focus**: +1 to two abilities (for comprehensive training like Military Training, +2 total)
- **Standard features get +2 total stat points** - maintains consistent power scaling

**Specialty Roll Power Levels:**
- **+3 Bonus**: Best for narrow, specific applications (academic research, craft expertise, commerce)
- **Advantage**: Best for broader applications that come up regularly (combat, social situations, survival)
- **Both**: Only for very narrow applications (weapon mastery with specific weapon type)

**Appropriate Scope Examples:**
- **Too Broad**: "Roll with advantage for any Wits check" 
- **Good Scope**: "Roll Wits with advantage for academic research"
- **Too Narrow**: "Roll Wits with +3 when reading books about dragons in libraries"
- **Good Scope**: "Roll Wits with +3 for academic research"

#### Keystone Feature Guidelines

**Enhanced Benefits:**
- **+3 stat points** distributed as player chooses (1+1+1, 2+1, or 3+0)
- **+5 maximum health** to represent significant personal growth
- **Enhanced specialty rolls** with additional once-per-session abilities

**Power Level Progression:**
- **Level 5**: Heroic capabilities, single extra action/reroll per session
- **Level 10**: Legendary capabilities, party-affecting abilities, death defiance
- **Level 15**: Mythic capabilities, reality-altering effects, automatic successes

**Session Abilities Guidelines:**
- **Level 5**: Minor reality bending (extra action, reroll, Power restoration)
- **Level 10**: Moderate reality bending (party buffs, death defiance, unlimited Power for one round)
- **Level 15**: Major reality bending (automatic success, forced critical, time manipulation)

#### Design Philosophy

**Regular Features Should:**
- Provide consistent, reliable benefits that come up in most sessions
- Enhance character specialization without overwhelming other characters
- Offer meaningful choices between different development paths
- Stay within the +2 stat guideline to maintain balance

### Feature Combination Rules

Instead of taking a separate feature during character advancement, players may choose to **combine two compatible features** they already possess to create a specialized mastery. This represents deepening expertise in a specific area rather than broadening capabilities.

#### Combination Requirements

**Compatible Features Must:**
- Both use the **same ability for their specialty rolls** (due to system limitations)
- Have **overlapping or complementary application areas** (GM discretion)
- **Example**: Scholar's Education (Wits +3 for academic research) + Arcane Scholar (Wits +3 for magical knowledge) = both use Wits rolls for intellectual pursuits

**Invalid Combinations:**
- Features with specialty rolls using different abilities
- Features with completely unrelated specialty roll applications
- **Example**: Military Training (Wits for tactical analysis) + Scout Training (Acrobatics for stealth) = different roll abilities

#### Combination Benefits

**Combined Stat Bonuses:**
- **Add together all stat bonuses** from both original features (can be to different abilities)
- **Add +1 to one ability** that either original feature could enhance
- **Example**: Feature A (+2 Will) + Feature B (+2 Wits) + bonus = +2 Will, +3 Wits

**Important**: While stat bonuses can affect different abilities, both features' **specialty rolls must use the same ability** for combination to work.

**Enhanced Specialty Roll:**
- Combine the mechanical benefits of both specialty rolls  
- **Advantage + Advantage** = Advantage 2 (dual advantage)
- **+3 Bonus + +3 Bonus** = Becomes +6 bonus
- **Advantage + +3 Bonus** = Keep advantage, add +3 bonus

**Feature Replacement:**
- The two original features are replaced by this single, more powerful combined feature
- This represents the evolution of separate training into integrated mastery

#### Combination Examples

**Scholar-Mage (Scholar's Education + Arcane Scholar):**
- **Original**: Scholar's Education (+2 Wits, +3 bonus for academic research) + Arcane Scholar (+2 Wits, +3 bonus for magical knowledge)
- **Combined**: +5 Wits total (+2+2+1), +6 bonus when rolling Wits for scholarly research involving magic
- **Application**: Researching magical history, understanding ancient spells, academic magical theory

**Master Tracker (Scout Tracker + Survival Expert):**
- **Original**: Scout Tracker (+1 Acrobatics, +1 Wits, advantage for tracking) + Survival Expert (+2 Wits, advantage for advanced survival)
- **Combined**: +1 Acrobatics, +4 Wits total (+1+2+1), advantage 2 when rolling Wits for wilderness tracking and survival
- **Application**: Expert-level pathfinding in dangerous environments

**Combat Savant (Combat Veteran + Tactical Instructor):**
- **Original**: Combat Veteran (+2 Physical, advantage for combat maneuvers) + Tactical Instructor (+1 Physical, +1 Wits, advantage for combat instruction)  
- **Combined**: +4 Physical total (+2+1+1), +1 Wits, advantage 2 when rolling Physical for advanced combat techniques
- **Application**: Master-level combat training and execution

#### Additional Combination Examples

**Master Healer (Temple Acolyte + Plague Doctor):**
- **Original**: Temple Acolyte (+2 Will, advantage for religious knowledge) + Plague Doctor (+1 Fortitude, +1 Will, advantage for treating disease and death)
- **Combined**: +4 Will total (+2+1+1), +1 Fortitude, advantage 2 when rolling Will for divine healing and medical treatment
- **Application**: Legendary healing combining spiritual power with medical expertise
- **Demonstrates**: Advantage + Advantage = Advantage 2

**Grand Artificer (Artisan's Training + Magical Aptitude):**
- **Original**: Artisan's Training (+2 Wits, advantage for craft expertise) + Magical Aptitude (+2 Will, +3 bonus for magical work)
- **Combined**: +3 Wits total (+2+1), +2 Will, advantage +3 when rolling Wits for magical crafting
- **Application**: Creating enchanted items and magical constructs
- **Demonstrates**: Advantage + Bonus = Advantage + Bonus

**Court Sage (Noble Heritage + Court Wizard):**
- **Original**: Noble Heritage (+2 Will, advantage for social etiquette) + Court Wizard (+1 Will, +1 Wits, advantage for court intrigue)
- **Combined**: +4 Will total (+2+1+1), +1 Wits, advantage 2 when rolling Will for high-society political manipulation
- **Application**: Master of noble court politics and magical influence
- **Demonstrates**: Advantage + Advantage = Advantage 2

**Desert Nomad (Wilderness Survivor + Frontier Survivor):**
- **Original**: Wilderness Survivor (+2 Fortitude, +3 bonus for wilderness survival) + Frontier Survivor (+1 Fortitude, +1 Wits, advantage for frontier survival)
- **Combined**: +4 Fortitude total (+2+1+1), +1 Wits, advantage +3 when rolling Wits for extreme environment survival
- **Application**: Surviving in the harshest environments known to civilization
- **Demonstrates**: Bonus + Advantage = Advantage + Bonus

#### GM Guidelines for Evaluating Combinations

**Approve When:**
- Applications genuinely overlap (magical research + academic research = scholarly magic research)
- Both features logically contribute to the same expertise area
- Player can describe how the combined training creates deeper specialization

**Require Justification When:**
- Applications are related but not identical (tracking + survival both use wilderness knowledge)
- Features come from different character development periods
- Combination seems like a power grab rather than narrative specialization

**Reject When:**
- Applications have no meaningful overlap (combat training + artistic performance)
- Features enhance completely different abilities with no narrative connection
- Combination would create overpowered specialty rolls (+8 bonuses, advantage +4, etc.)

**Power Level Control:**
- Combined features provide significant power increase in their specialized area
- Players sacrifice two features to create one extremely specialized ability
- Enhanced specialty rolls should be impressive but narrowly focused
- The +1 bonus ensures combinations are attractive without being mandatory

**Balance Considerations:**
- **Trade-off**: Two versatile features become one highly specialized feature
- **Opportunity Cost**: Players give up breadth for exceptional depth
- **Situational Power**: Combined features excel dramatically in their niche but nowhere else

This system rewards focused character development while maintaining the choice between specialization (combining features) and versatility (taking different features).

**Keystone Features Should:**
- Mark major character development milestones
- Provide "wow" moments that feel genuinely special
- Scale appropriately with the epic nature of high-level play
- Include session abilities that can turn the tide of critical moments

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- **Power Creep**: Don't exceed stated stat limits
- **Too Broad**: Specialty rolls shouldn't apply to everything
- **Too Situational**: Features should be useful in most campaigns
- **Redundancy**: New features should offer different benefits than existing ones

#### Custom Feature Creation

**Step 1: Concept**
- What aspect of the character does this represent?
- How does it fit their background or development?
- What situations should it help with?

**Step 2: Mechanical Design**
- Choose stat distribution within guidelines (+2 for regular, +3 for keystones)
- Select specialty roll type and scope
- For Keystones: choose appropriate session ability

**Step 3: Flavor and Balance**
- Write compelling descriptive text
- Ensure power level matches guidelines
- Check that it doesn't overshadow existing options

**Step 4: Testing**
- Consider how often it will come up in play
- Evaluate impact on party balance
- Adjust scope if too broad or narrow

### Gear (Equipment Effects)
Equipment can enhance your abilities when it's relevant to what you're doing:
- **Lockpicks** might give +3 Acrobatics when picking locks
- **A fine blade** might add +2 Physical when fighting
- **Quality armor** might give +3 AC (Physical) for defense only

**Important**: Gear bonuses only apply when the equipment actually helps. Lockpicks don't help you climb walls!

### Equipment Attunement

To prevent overwhelming power accumulation, characters have limited **Attunement Slots** for their most powerful magical items:

**Attunement Slot Progression:**
- **Levels 1-5:** 2 attunement slots
- **Levels 6-10:** 3 attunement slots  
- **Levels 11-15:** 4 attunement slots
- **Levels 16-20:** 5 attunement slots

**Items Requiring Attunement:**
- Ability-boosting items with +3 or higher bonuses
- Weapons with +3 or higher enhancement bonuses
- Armor with universal AC bonuses
- Items with active magical powers

**Items NOT Requiring Attunement:**
- Basic +2 enhancement bonuses
- Single-stat AC bonuses (like +3 Physical AC armor)
- Mundane equipment and tools

This system ensures characters make meaningful choices about their most powerful equipment while preventing unlimited power stacking.

#### AC-Only Effects
Some equipment provides defensive benefits without making you stronger overall:
- **Armor and Shields**: Provide AC bonuses that only apply to defense calculations
- **Protective gear** makes you harder to hit without improving your athletics or intimidation
- **Weapons** still provide general Physical bonuses since you actively use them for both attack and defense

### Status Effects (Temporary Changes)
These represent temporary conditions affecting your character:
- **Blessed** might give +3 Will while active
- **Poisoned** might give -2 Physical and -2 Fortitude
- **Exhausted** might give -1 to all abilities

### Status Effect Scaling

Status effects become more severe as campaigns progress to remain relevant against powerful characters:

**Early Game (Levels 1-5):**
- Light effects: -2 to one ability
- Moderate effects: -2 to two abilities, or -3 to one ability
- Severe effects: -4 to one ability, or disadvantage on specific actions

**Mid Game (Levels 6-10):**
- Light effects: -3 to one ability  
- Moderate effects: -4 to one ability, or -2 to three abilities
- Severe effects: -6 to one ability, or disadvantage on one ability type

**Late Game (Levels 11+):**
- Light effects: -4 to one ability, or 10% penalty (whichever is higher)
- Moderate effects: -6 to one ability, or 15% penalty (whichever is higher)  
- Severe effects: -8 to one ability, or 20% penalty, or disadvantage on multiple abilities

**Status Effect Dogpiling:** High-level enemies often apply multiple status effects in sequence, creating cumulative penalties that remain threatening even against powerful characters.

### Everything Stacks!
When multiple bonuses apply to the same ability for the same situation, they all add together. 

**Example**: A Military Training character (Physical +1) with base Physical 16 wielding a Fine Sword (Physical +1) wearing Quality Armor (AC +2) would have:
- **Physical 18** for melee attacks, athletics, and intimidation
- **AC 30** for melee defense (Physical 18 + 11 + 2 from armor)

The armor's AC bonus doesn't make them stronger - it only makes them harder to hit. If they were also Blessed (Will +3), they'd have enhanced Will for magical abilities, but bonuses only affect their specific situations.

## Combat Basics

Combat uses the same simple system with a few extra rules:

### Initiative
At the start of combat, everyone rolls initiative using the current system (typically involving Acrobatics and Wits). Higher results go first.

### Attacking
To attack someone, roll 1d20 + relevant ability vs. their **Armor Class**.

**Armor Class = defender's relevant ability + 11**

Usually this means Physical + 11 for melee defense, or Acrobatics + 11 for ranged defense, but creative players might use other abilities in specific situations.

### Multi-Stat AC Targeting System

Each of your five abilities has its own separate Armor Class:

- **Physical AC** = Physical + 11 (resisting physical attacks, weapon strikes)
- **Acrobatics AC** = Acrobatics + 11 (dodging projectiles, avoiding area effects)
- **Fortitude AC** = Fortitude + 11 (resisting poison, disease, exhaustion)
- **Will AC** = Will + 11 (resisting mental effects, magical compulsion)
- **Wits AC** = Wits + 11 (resisting deception, illusions, confusion)

When making attacks, you can target **multiple stats simultaneously** with a single roll. This creates tactical depth where different character builds excel against different types of threats.

#### Attack Resolution
- **1 Success**: Deal damage to the target
- **2 Successes**: Deal damage AND apply a status effect

#### Tactical Examples
A wizard casting *Mind Blast* might target both Will AC (primary) and Wits AC (secondary):
- **1 Success** (beats one AC): 8 psychic damage
- **2 Successes** (beats both ACs): 8 psychic damage + *Confused* status effect

A rogue's poison blade might target Physical AC and Fortitude AC:
- **1 Success**: 6 weapon damage  
- **2 Successes**: 6 weapon damage + *Poisoned* status effect

#### Defensive Specialization
This system allows characters to excel at defending against specific threat types:
- **Fighters** have high Physical AC (resist weapon attacks)
- **Wizards** have high Will AC (resist magical compulsion and mental attacks)
- **Scouts** have high Acrobatics AC (avoid projectiles and traps)
- **Scholars** have high Wits AC (see through deceptions and illusions)
- **Barbarians** have high Fortitude AC (shrug off poisons and diseases)

A wizard might be the best "tank" against magical enemies that primarily target Will, even though a fighter would be better against physical threats.

### Damage
When you hit, you deal damage based on your weapon and experience level:

### Damage and Weapon Scaling

Weapon damage increases as characters advance to maintain combat pacing:

**Early Career (Levels 1-5):**
- **Light weapons** (daggers, clubs): 3-6 damage
- **Medium weapons** (swords, axes): 4-8 damage  
- **Heavy weapons** (greatswords, mauls): 5-10 damage

**Experienced Adventurers (Levels 6-10):**
- **Light weapons**: 5-10 damage
- **Medium weapons**: 7-14 damage
- **Heavy weapons**: 9-18 damage

**Veteran Adventurers (Levels 11-15):**
- **Light weapons**: 8-16 damage
- **Medium weapons**: 12-24 damage  
- **Heavy weapons**: 15-30 damage

**Legendary Heroes (Levels 16-20):**
- **Light weapons**: 12-24 damage
- **Medium weapons**: 18-36 damage
- **Heavy weapons**: 22-44 damage

This scaling reflects better weapons, combat training, and tactical expertise. Enhanced by features, critical hits, and action card combinations. **Combat Powers and spells follow similar scaling progression.**

Damage reduces the target's **Resolve** (their health/stamina pool).

### Combat Powers
Some characters have special abilities that cost **Power** points to use. These might be magical spells, advanced techniques, or special equipment abilities. Each power describes how it works and what it costs.

## Encounter Building for GMs

### Encounter Difficulty Rating
Since ability scores are used directly in rolls, encounter balance focuses on total combat capability relative to your party:

Use these benchmarks when creating enemies for different campaign phases:

**Early Game Enemies (Levels 1-5):**
- Weak enemies: Abilities 10-14
- Standard enemies: Abilities 14-18  
- Strong enemies: Abilities 18-22
- Boss enemies: Abilities 20-24

**Mid Game Enemies (Levels 6-10):**
- Weak enemies: Abilities 14-18
- Standard enemies: Abilities 18-22
- Strong enemies: Abilities 22-26
- Boss enemies: Abilities 24-28

**Late Game Enemies (Levels 11-15):**
- Weak enemies: Abilities 18-22
- Standard enemies: Abilities 22-26
- Strong enemies: Abilities 26-30
- Boss enemies: Abilities 28-32

**End Game Enemies (Levels 16-20):**
- Weak enemies: Abilities 22-26
- Standard enemies: Abilities 26-30
- Strong enemies: Abilities 30-34
- Boss enemies: Abilities 32-36

Enemies don't need complex feature builds - their raw ability scores should match or slightly exceed party capabilities for appropriate challenge levels.

### Action Economy Balance
The number of actions per side matters as much as individual strength:

**Single Strong Opponent:**
- Give bonus actions or multiple attacks per turn
- Consider special reactions or legendary actions
- Higher abilities compensate for being outnumbered

**Multiple Weak Opponents:**
- Lower individual abilities but coordinated tactics
- Focus fire and flanking opportunities
- Overwhelm through numbers rather than individual strength

**Mixed Encounters:**
- Combine one strong leader with several weaker allies
- Create tactical depth with different threat types
- Balance total threat level against party capabilities

### Combat Length Guidelines

Target these durations for engaging encounters:

**Quick Skirmishes:** 2-3 rounds
- Minor threats, random encounters
- Single weak enemy or few very weak enemies

**Standard Encounters:** 4-5 rounds  
- Main adventure encounters
- Balanced challenge for party level
- Most combat encounters should target this range

**Boss Encounters:** 6-8 rounds
- Major story antagonists
- Phase transitions, legendary actions
- Double normal enemy health, special abilities

**Epic Encounters:** 8+ rounds
- Campaign climax battles
- Multiple phases, environmental hazards
- Legendary resistance, ongoing effects

**Maintaining Combat Pace:** The damage scaling and status effect progression ensure these targets remain achievable across all character levels.

### Fail-Forward Philosophy

Combat outcomes shouldn't be binary win/lose scenarios. Encourage varied results that drive story forward:

**Victory Variations:**
- **Clean Victory**: Enemies defeated, party unharmed - story continues smoothly
- **Costly Victory**: Success with injuries/resource drain - consequences for future encounters  
- **Pyrrhic Victory**: Win with major losses - story complications and difficult choices

**Defeat Variations:**
- **Capture**: Enemies need information or hostages - interrogation/rescue scenarios
- **Retreat**: Party or enemies flee - pursuit, regrouping, or temporary setbacks
- **Partial Defeat**: Some party members escape - rescue missions and split objectives

**Environmental Outcomes:**
- **Time Pressure**: Collapses, reinforcements, or other pressures force tactical decisions
- **Escape Routes**: Combat ends with pursuit, chase scenes, or strategic withdrawals
- **Objectives**: Combat success/failure affects broader mission goals beyond just defeating enemies

**Social Consequences:**
- **Reputation**: Combat outcomes affect how NPCs react to the party
- **Legal Issues**: Defeating guards might create legal problems despite victory
- **Political Ramifications**: Who the party fights affects larger story dynamics

GMs should prepare multiple outcome paths for each encounter, considering how different results advance the narrative and create meaningful consequences for player choices.

## Character Creation Quick Start

Ready to make your first character? Here's the fastest way:

### Step 1: Choose Your Ability Scores
Use the **Standard Array**: 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11
Assign these numbers to your five abilities however you like.

### Step 2: Calculate Resources
- **Resolve** = Fortitude + 10
- **Power** = Will + 5

### Step 3: Pick Your Background
Choose 1-2 **Features** that represent your character's past:
- **City-Raised**: +2 Wits, plus special rolls for urban knowledge
- **Military Training**: +1 Physical, +1 Acrobatics, plus special rolls for tactical analysis  
- **Scholar's Education**: +2 Wits, plus special rolls for academic research
- **Wilderness Survivor**: +2 Fortitude, plus special rolls for outdoor survival

### Step 4: Starting Gear
Pick an equipment package or work with your GM:
- **Warrior**: Weapon, armor, basic gear
- **Scholar**: Books, writing supplies, light equipment
- **Survivalist**: Wilderness gear, tools
- **Noble**: Fine clothes, social tools, quality items

### Step 5: Describe Your Character
Give them a name, describe what they look like, and think about their personality and goals.

## Advanced Options

Once you're comfortable with the basics, ERPS offers many ways to customize your experience:

### Alternative Character Creation
- **Point Buy**: Distribute points among abilities for precise builds
- **Rolling**: Random generation for unexpected characters

### Expanded Features
Create custom backgrounds and abilities using the Feature Creator

### Magic and Powers
Develop supernatural abilities using the Combat Power system

### Transformations
Temporarily or permanently change your character's capabilities

### Character Progression
As your character adventures and grows, they naturally become tougher and more capable:

**Universal Growth:** All characters gain these features as they advance through major story milestones:
- **Experienced** (mid-campaign): +5 Fortitude from surviving dangers and hardships
- **Veteran** (late-campaign): +5 additional Fortitude from years of adventuring

This means even scholarly characters who never invest in combat training still become more resilient over time - a veteran wizard has learned to survive in dangerous situations, even if they're not as tough as a veteran warrior.

**Additional Development:** Characters also gain new abilities, features, or equipment that enhance their specializations, creating distinct roles while ensuring everyone can survive the escalating challenges of higher-level adventures.

## Playing Your First Game

### For New Players
1. **Focus on your character's strengths** - look for ways your abilities and features can help
2. **Describe what you want to do** - let the GM worry about which ability to roll
3. **Think about your gear** - remember that the right tool for the job makes a big difference
4. **Ask questions** - experienced players love helping newcomers

### For GMs New to ERPS
1. **Say yes when features apply** - if a player's background reasonably helps, let it help
2. **Remember gear is contextual** - lockpicks help with locks, not everything
3. **Use the DC guidelines** - but don't be afraid to adjust based on the story
4. **Let abilities be flexible** - if a player has a creative idea for using an ability, consider it
