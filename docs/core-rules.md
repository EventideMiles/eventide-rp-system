# Core Rules
## How to Play the Eventide RP System

Welcome to the Eventide RP System! This guide will teach you everything you need to know to create characters and play the game. Whether you're completely new to tabletop RPGs or coming from other systems, you'll find ERPS's approach both familiar and refreshingly different.

## What Makes ERPS Different?

Most RPGs give you a character sheet with fixed numbers that rarely change. ERPS is built around a simple but powerful idea: **your character's capabilities change based on what they're doing and what they have with them.**

A scholar with lockpicks isn't just "a scholar" - they're a scholar *with the right tools for the job*. A city-raised character isn't just good at everything - they excel when their urban knowledge actually matters. This creates characters that feel real and dynamic, where your background, gear, and current situation all matter.

## The Five Abilities

Every character in ERPS has five core abilities that define what they can do:

### Acrobatics
Your agility, balance, and finesse. Use Acrobatics for:
- **Stealth and sneaking** past guards
- **Climbing** walls or escaping through windows  
- **Ranged combat** with bows or thrown weapons
- **Delicate tasks** like picking locks or disarming traps
- **Balance and coordination** when crossing narrow ledges

### Physical
Your raw strength and physical prowess. Use Physical for:
- **Melee combat** with most weapons
- **Breaking down doors** or forcing your way through
- **Lifting heavy objects** or carrying unconscious allies
- **Athletics** like swimming or jumping
- **Intimidation** through physical presence

### Fortitude
Your resilience, stamina, and toughness. Use Fortitude for:
- **Resisting poison** or disease
- **Endurance tasks** like long-distance travel
- **Surviving harsh environments** (cold, heat, starvation)
- **Recovering from injuries** or exhaustion
- **Withstanding mental pressure** in some situations

*Fortitude also determines your **Resolve** (health/stamina): Fortitude + 10*

### Will
Your mental strength, magical aptitude, and force of personality. Use Will for:
- **Magic and supernatural abilities** (if your campaign includes them)
- **Leadership** and inspiring others
- **Resisting mental effects** like fear or charm
- **Social situations** requiring authority or persuasion
- **Activating magical items** or combat powers

*Will also determines your **Power** (magical energy): Will + 5*

### Wits
Your intelligence, perception, and tactical thinking. Use Wits for:
- **Noticing details** and spotting hidden things
- **Solving puzzles** and understanding complex problems
- **Remembering information** about history, lore, or people
- **Tactical planning** in combat or complex situations
- **Understanding social situations** and reading people

## How Rolls Work

When you want to do something with an uncertain outcome, you make a roll:

**Roll 1d20 + your relevant ability score**

That's it! No complicated modifiers to calculate - just add your ability score directly to the d20 result.

### Difficulty Classes

Your Game Master (GM) sets a target number called a Difficulty Class (DC). If your total meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed!

- **DC 15**: Trivial tasks (routine activities with minimal risk)
- **DC 20**: Easy challenges (simple tasks requiring basic competence)
- **DC 25**: Moderate challenges (standard difficulties requiring focus)
- **DC 30**: Hard tasks (difficult challenges requiring skill and preparation)
- **DC 35**: Very Hard (expert-level challenges requiring exceptional ability)
- **DC 40**: Extreme feats (legendary achievements at the edge of possibility)
- **DC 45**: Mythic challenges (epic feats requiring mastery)
- **DC 50+**: Divine tasks (godlike achievements requiring extraordinary circumstances)

The beauty of this scale is that it grows with your character. What starts as an impossible challenge (DC 40) for a new character becomes achievable for an experienced adventurer with the right training and equipment.

### Example
Sarah's character has Acrobatics 14 and wants to sneak past a guard. The GM decides this is a moderate challenge (DC 25). Sarah rolls a d20 and gets 12. Her total is 12 + 14 = 26, which beats the DC 25 - she successfully sneaks past!

## What Changes Your Abilities?

Here's where ERPS gets interesting. Your base ability scores are just the starting point. Several things can modify them:

### Features (Permanent Traits)
Features represent your character's background, training, and inherent abilities. They can:
- **Add permanent bonuses** to your abilities
- **Give you special rolls** for specific situations
- **Do both**

**Example**: Military Training might give you +1 Physical and +1 Acrobatics (from conditioning), *plus* let you make a special "tactical knowledge" roll in combat situations.

### Gear (Equipment Effects)
Equipment can enhance your abilities when it's relevant to what you're doing:
- **Lockpicks** might give +3 Acrobatics when picking locks
- **A fine blade** might add +1 Physical when fighting
- **Quality armor** might give +2 AC (Physical) for defense only

**Important**: Gear bonuses only apply when the equipment actually helps. Lockpicks don't help you climb walls!

#### AC-Only Effects
Some equipment provides defensive benefits without making you stronger overall:
- **Armor and Shields**: Provide AC bonuses that only apply to defense calculations
- **Protective gear** makes you harder to hit without improving your athletics or intimidation
- **Weapons** still provide general Physical bonuses since you actively use them for both attack and defense

### Status Effects (Temporary Changes)
These represent temporary conditions affecting your character:
- **Blessed** might give +3 Will while active
- **Poisoned** might give -2 Physical and -2 Fortitude
- **Exhausted** might give -1 to all abilities

### Everything Stacks!
When multiple bonuses apply to the same ability for the same situation, they all add together. 

**Example**: A Military Veteran (Physical +1) with base Physical 16 wielding a Fine Sword (Physical +1) wearing Quality Armor (AC +2) would have:
- **Physical 18** for melee attacks, athletics, and intimidation
- **AC 30** for melee defense (Physical 18 + 11 + 2 from armor)

The armor's AC bonus doesn't make them stronger - it only makes them harder to hit. If they were also Blessed (Will +3), they'd have enhanced Will for magical abilities, but bonuses only affect their specific situations.

## Combat Basics

Combat uses the same simple system with a few extra rules:

### Initiative
At the start of combat, everyone rolls initiative using the current system (typically involving Acrobatics and Wits). Higher results go first.

### Attacking
To attack someone, roll 1d20 + relevant ability vs. their **Armor Class**.

**Armor Class = defender's relevant ability + 11**

Usually this means Physical + 11 for melee defense, or Acrobatics + 11 for ranged defense, but creative players might use other abilities in specific situations.

### Damage
When you hit, you deal damage based on your weapon and experience level:

**Early Career:**
- **Light weapons** (daggers, clubs): 2-4 damage
- **Medium weapons** (swords, axes): 3-6 damage  
- **Heavy weapons** (greatswords, mauls): 4-8 damage

**As characters advance**, damage scales through better equipment, combat training features, and action card combinations. Experienced adventurers might deal 6-10 damage with heavy weapon types.

Damage reduces the target's **Resolve** (their health/stamina pool).

### Combat Powers
Some characters have special abilities that cost **Power** points to use. These might be magical spells, advanced techniques, or special equipment abilities. Each power describes how it works and what it costs.

## Encounter Building for GMs

### Encounter Difficulty Rating
Since ability scores are used directly in rolls, encounter balance focuses on total combat capability relative to your party:

- **Easy**: Single NPC with abilities 2-3 points lower than party average, or multiple weak NPCs
- **Moderate**: Single NPC with abilities matching party average, or 2-3 NPCs with lower abilities  
- **Hard**: Single NPC with abilities 2-3 points higher than party average, or multiple moderate NPCs
- **Deadly**: Multiple strong NPCs or single NPC with abilities 5+ points higher than party average

**Example**: If your party has average abilities of 14, a moderate encounter might feature an NPC with abilities around 14, while a hard encounter could have an NPC with abilities of 17.

### Action Economy Balance
The number of actions per side matters as much as individual strength:

**Single Strong Opponent:**
- Give bonus actions or multiple attacks per turn
- Consider special reactions or legendary actions
- Higher abilities compensate for being outnumbered

**Multiple Weak Opponents:**
- Lower individual abilities but coordinated tactics
- Focus fire and flanking opportunities
- Overwhelm through numbers rather than individual strength

**Mixed Encounters:**
- Combine one strong leader with several weaker allies
- Create tactical depth with different threat types
- Balance total threat level against party capabilities

### Combat Length Guidelines
Target these durations for engaging but decisive combat:

- **Regular Encounters**: 5 rounds maximum
- **Major Boss Fights**: 7 rounds maximum  
- **Quick Skirmishes**: 2-3 rounds

**Health and Damage Scaling**: The universal Experienced (+5 Fortitude) and Veteran (+5 Fortitude) features ensure all characters' health scales appropriately. Weapons and combat abilities should scale to maintain these target combat lengths across character progression.

## Character Creation Quick Start

Ready to make your first character? Here's the fastest way:

### Step 1: Choose Your Ability Scores
Use the **Standard Array**: 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11
Assign these numbers to your five abilities however you like.

### Step 2: Calculate Resources
- **Resolve** = Fortitude + 10
- **Power** = Will + 5

### Step 3: Pick Your Background
Choose 1-2 **Features** that represent your character's past:
- **City-Raised**: +1 Wits, plus special rolls for urban knowledge
- **Military Training**: +1 Physical, +1 Acrobatics
- **Scholar's Education**: +1 Wits, plus special rolls for academic research
- **Wilderness Survivor**: +1 Fortitude, plus special rolls for outdoor survival

### Step 4: Starting Gear
Pick an equipment package or work with your GM:
- **Warrior**: Weapon, armor, basic gear
- **Scholar**: Books, writing supplies, light equipment
- **Survivalist**: Wilderness gear, tools
- **Noble**: Fine clothes, social tools, quality items

### Step 5: Describe Your Character
Give them a name, describe what they look like, and think about their personality and goals.

## Advanced Options

Once you're comfortable with the basics, ERPS offers many ways to customize your experience:

### Alternative Character Creation
- **Point Buy**: Distribute points among abilities for precise builds
- **Rolling**: Random generation for unexpected characters

### Expanded Features
Create custom backgrounds and abilities using the Feature Creator

### Magic and Powers
Develop supernatural abilities using the Combat Power system

### Transformations
Temporarily or permanently change your character's capabilities

### Character Progression
As your character adventures and grows, they naturally become tougher and more capable:

**Universal Growth:** All characters gain these features as they advance through major story milestones:
- **Experienced** (mid-campaign): +5 Fortitude from surviving dangers and hardships
- **Veteran** (late-campaign): +5 additional Fortitude from years of adventuring

This means even scholarly characters who never invest in combat training still become more resilient over time - a veteran wizard has learned to survive in dangerous situations, even if they're not as tough as a veteran warrior.

**Additional Development:** Characters also gain new abilities, features, or equipment that enhance their specializations, creating distinct roles while ensuring everyone can survive the escalating challenges of higher-level adventures.

## Playing Your First Game

### For New Players
1. **Focus on your character's strengths** - look for ways your abilities and features can help
2. **Describe what you want to do** - let the GM worry about which ability to roll
3. **Think about your gear** - remember that the right tool for the job makes a big difference
4. **Ask questions** - experienced players love helping newcomers

### For GMs New to ERPS
1. **Say yes when features apply** - if a player's background reasonably helps, let it help
2. **Remember gear is contextual** - lockpicks help with locks, not everything
3. **Use the DC guidelines** - but don't be afraid to adjust based on the story
4. **Let abilities be flexible** - if a player has a creative idea for using an ability, consider it
