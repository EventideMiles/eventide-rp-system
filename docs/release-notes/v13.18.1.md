# v13.18.1 - Enhanced Action Chain Control

**Release Date**: January 2026

## New Features

### 🔄 Enhanced Action Chain Control

**We've significantly improved the action chain system to give GMs more control over status effects and action execution.**

#### Key Improvements

- **Mixed Attribute Rolls**: Added a new "Mixed Attribute" type of roll for combat powers and action cards that let you take the average of 2 stats for an action. This is particularly useful in situations like a vampire choosing between drinking blood and kissing, where the action may be "half strength, half charisma."
- **Status Effect Fix**: Fixed a bug where status effects, if they weren't applied in the first action of an action chain, wouldn't ever apply.
- **Selective Status Application**: Added a new way of selecting which status will apply on any given use of an action chain so that status effects can be selectively applied by the GM.

#### Mixed Attribute Rolls

This new roll type allows you to combine two attributes to create a more balanced action. For example:

- A vampire might roll the average of their Strength and Charisma for a "vampiric kiss" action.
- A rogue might use the average of Dexterity and Intelligence for a "trick" action.

The result is always rounded **up**, ensuring that the action is slightly more powerful than either attribute alone.

#### Status Effect Fix

Previously, status effects would only apply if they were used in the first action of an action chain. This fix ensures that status effects can be applied at any point in the chain, providing more flexibility in combat and other scenarios.

#### Selective Status Application

GMs can now choose which status effects will apply on any given use of an action chain. This is especially useful in cases where multiple statuses have the same underlying mechanics but different visual or narrative effects (e.g., "drinking blood" vs. "kissing" in the case of a vampire). This feature allows the GM to maintain narrative consistency while still providing variety in gameplay.
