# v13.19.0 - Action Card Execution Flow

**Release Date**: January 2026

## New Features

### 🎴 Action Card Execution Logic Improvements

**New Application Counter System**
Action Cards now have a configurable counter that determines how many times their status should be applied when conditions are met:

- **Range**: 0 to any positive integer (where 0 equals infinite applications)
- **Default Value**: 1
- **Purpose**: Allows GMs to control how often an action card's effect triggers during execution

### ⚔️ Tactical Combat Mechanics

**Fail On First Miss Setting**
New toggle for attack action cards with strategic implications:

- **Default**: `true`
- **Behavior**: If the first hit fails to connect, subsequent hits are skipped entirely
- **Use Cases**: Attacks where the initial attempt determines whether future hits should be attempted
- **Example**: A sniper might retry multiple shots if the first misses, or a heavy weapon that should only fire once if the first shot is blocked

### 🖼️ Embedded Item Synchronization

**Fixed Image Icon Alignment**

- **Issue**: Embedded item sheets were displaying incorrect/parentless icons
- **Solution**: Automated script added to migrate existing items and fix icon synchronization
- **Status**: Now properly displays active effect icons matching the parent character's image

### 🎲 Dice Roll System Enhancements

**Minimum Dice Value Configuration**

- **System Setting**: `minDiceValue`
- **Range**: 1 to 20 (default: 1)
- **Purpose**: Prevents dice results from falling outside valid ranges
- **Implementation**: Respects active status effects when determining valid roll ranges

### 📊 Derived Character Values

**Max Power and Max Resolve as Derived Fields**

- **Previous Approach**: Manual input fields prone to inconsistent values
- **New Approach**: Automatically calculated values for consistency
- **Benefits**: Ensures all actors use identical max values within a game
- **Read-Only**: Actor max values are now read-only to prevent manual overrides

### 🎛️ Execution Control

**Action Card Execution Limit**

- **System Setting**: `executionLimit`
- **Range**: 0 to 100 (default: 30)
- **Purpose**: Prevents explosive dice rolls and unrealistic value spikes
- **Behavior**: Limits total dice rolls applied to action cards during execution
- **Default**: 30 maximum applications per action card

### 📝 Localization Updates

All new settings and fields have been added to localization files:

- `/lang/en.json` for English translations
- Proper key names and display strings
- Consistent terminology across the system
