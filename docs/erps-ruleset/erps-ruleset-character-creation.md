# ERPS Character Creation Ruleset

## Fast Reference

- Ability points @ level 1: 16
  - Maximum ability score At Level 1: 6
  - otherwise unlimited
- Ability points per level up: 2
- Max Health: 100 + (10 * Fortitude)
- Max Power: 5 + Fortitude + Will
- 3 to 5 action card moves that fit your character's theming
  - Try to stick to basic or advanced unless you have GM approval.
  - If power cost, typical is 1 for basic, 2 for advanced, 3+ for ultimate
  - Typical damage should be d2 + d2 for basic, 2d2 + 2d2 for advanced, 3d2 + 3d2 for ultimate
  - Set config flags to match what your move does: a gun costs more than 1 bullet if its fired more than once and not every thing should be doing both damage and status per move.
- If your move does statuses see [Full Rules](#full-rules) for more info.

## Full Rules

1. All characters will be starting at level 1. Each will receive a total of 16 ability point to spread across their stats as they see fit with ONE limitation: 6 should be the highest any given character's stats go during level 1. This limitation is lifted from level 2 onward.
2. Characters should define action cards to do their typical combat maneuvers. I'd highly suggest having  at least 3 to 5 action cards to begin with, but you can have more or less depending on what your character should logically be capable of.
    - Typical damage should be **d2 + d2** or less for a basic ability, **2d2 + 2d2** for an advanced ability, and **3d2 + 3d2** for an ultimate ability.
    - **Typical repetitions should be set to 9 or less.** I tend to distribute as follows: 1 for basic abilities that inflict status effects, up to d6+3 for basic abilities that do not inflict status, 1d3+2 for advanced abilities that inflict status effects, up to d4+5 for advanced abilities that do not inflict statuses, up to d2+7 for ultimate abilities: these should be rare and have some other cost associated with them (IE: taking more than one action, needing to charge across a turn, or leaving the user vulnerable after their execution whether they hit or not.)
    - Typical status repetitions should be kept at 1, fail on first miss should be kept on, damage per repetition should be turned on if its a multi-hit move, typically repeat to hit should be turned on, and if something like gun shots should turn on cost per repetition if inventory tracking.
    - Typical action cost for basic combat powers should be 1, for advanced combat powers should be 2, 3+ for ultimate abilities.
3. Regarding status effects: aim for reduction in one to two abilities that make sense for the status effect. IE: if you shoot an arrow through somebody's knee that's probably going to be an advanced damage set since its a trick shot, and it would typically reduce 2 stats by 2 each (acro, will would make the most sense in this case.)
    - If you want to spread the reduction out over multiple abilities, you can do so. So keep in mind that a basic ability should be reducing 2 stats 1 point each or one stat 2, advanced should spread 4 as makes sense, ults should be 6+ but should make sense to both you and the GM.
4. Typically I give players 1 feature and one "stat impacting" item on starting. Features can be anything you'd like, from a stat bonus that also grants advantage on certain types of rolls to drawbacks that do the same: flavor them for your characters and as a GM do NOT be afraid to hand them out for big events in your campaign either good OR bad.
    - For the "stat impacting" item I tend to leave that in one of two categories, either it grants them advantage on a basic or advanced attack or it gives a pure buff to one of their stats.
5. Other items can be added as your setting allows: just remember to try to stick to 1 or less "stat impacting" item and keep any pure bonuses on items at +1 or less at least at early levels.
6. Make 2 recovery moves: the first should be a self target heal for 20, the second should be a self target power up that has an action card on it that costs -1 actions. See combat documentation (TODO: Add link when complete) for details.

## Feeling Creative?

Remember that every single image step in the action card process, from the image that shows when you deal damage to the one that shows when you attack to the ones that come off your status effects can be fully customized. While its not expected for you to change all of them, I encourage my players to customize to their heart's content and to enjoy the process. Check with your GM about rules for how many images you're allowed to have (I tend to use webp file format so storage space isn't an issue, to any aspiring GMs out there I'd suggest you do the same.)
