## State-Based Actions

If there's something going on with the map that has nothing to do with a particular character's actions it should execute at the END of each round of combat. IE: if you're standing on a burning area and you do not leave that burning area you'd take the 'burning damage' at the end of the round. same for if the area you're in catches fire mid-turn. You can typically use reaction actions to react to state-based actions spreading on your turn (IE: someone throws a molatov cocktail at you: you react to knock it away or back. You'll still catch the square on fire, but as part of the reaction you can move half your speed as long as your reaction challenge succeeds.)

## Turn Flow

> **Game Master's Guide:** Track each character's available actions at the start of their turn. A typical turn grants 2 Full Actions, 1 Move Action, 1 Cleanse Action, and 1 Reaction. Encourage players to think tactically about how they spend these resources—unused actions are lost, so remind them to convert leftovers into recovery or decisive strikes. The choices they make with these actions will define the flow and drama of your combat scenes.

Each combat begins with each prepared combatant gaining a reaction action. See [Reaction Actions](#reaction-actions) for what can be done with reactions.

### At the beginning of each of your turns in combat you gain the following

- 2 Full Actions
- 1 Move Action
- 1 Cleanse Action
- 1 Reaction

You much choose to use each of these actions or lose them. You may also use any of your actions OTHER than a cleanse action to recover 20 HP or 1 power.

It is highly suggested that if you have any actions left at the end of your turn that are going to expire that you either use them or conver them into recovery to maintain yourself as combat progresses.

If you drop to 0 resolve you are unable to act. An ally can spend an action to help you recover 10 HP if they're directly adjacent to you and there are no active threats preventing them from doing so. If there are any threats nearby, known or unknown, your ally's heal attempt on you will provide an immediate full action that threat can use against them or you, so beware.

## Full Actions

A full action on each turn can be used to execute nearly any action card you have on your character. The exceptions will be decided by GMs (IE: an ultimate ability may consume 2 full actions, or a full and a move, or even your complete turn's action set to use.).

As full actions are the most powerful type of action you may convert any number of full actions into move actions or cleanse actions in a turn. You can also turn them into the special [prepared action](#prepared-actions) to react to things BEFORE they happen.

Remember, action cards can do many things: damage, grappling, psychic attacks, gunshots: they all fall under action cards and action cards consume full actions.

## Move Actions

A move action is used to travel 25 ft in any direction you wish. If you're travelling over difficult terrain (IE: super rocky ground) then that speed is halved.

If you take a move action while you have a 'grapple' status on someone else you can move up to half your speed with them, but must perform an appropriate roll to maintain the grapple. IE: if its a 'manuverability' grapple you can roll Acrobatics, if its strenth you roll Physical, if its psychokinetic or influence based you roll will.

When you end a move your opponent is placed in the square that makes most sense for your movement: typically the square either just ahead of you or just behind you in the path you took. You may put them in [state-based hazards](#state-based-actions) but they may use their reaction to attempt to break your grapple and place themselves up to half their speed away from you in a direction they choose.

## Reaction Actions

A reaction can be used, within reason, to respond to threats to yourself. Reactions happen AFTER the effect they're supposed to be reacting to in this system: so be aware that any status effects or damage will already have impacted by the time your reaction goes off. Your GM may decide to do it otherwise, but ultimately this design decision was made to speed up combat.

## Prepared Actions

> **Game Master's Guide:** When players announce a prepared action, note both their trigger condition ("when the mage casts a spell") and their planned response ("I throw a rock to disrupt it"). When that trigger occurs during someone else's turn, pause the action and adjudicate the attempt. Run the challenge roll between the prepared character and their target, and award the result: a successful preparation interrupts the action and applies damage, while a failed preparation leaves the character to face the consequence. These moments create cinematic tension—savor them!

As a player you might see something coming they can turn their full actions into **preapared actions**. Essentially a prepared action has the following components:

1. The Trigger (what they're looking for)
2. The Action (what they'll do about it)

A good example of this is if a player knows a mage is about to cast a spell, but they intend to counterspell or otherwise try to disrupt the casting. They would say "I prepare an action: if that mage casts a spell I'm going to throw a rock at him trying to stop him." They would then follow the [challenge rules](#challenge-rules), in this case acrobatics from the prepared party and either acrotatics or will from the defender, to determine whether the action is interrupted.

### Some Example Reaction Actions

- Knocking back a hazard or projectile: you'll still take damage but if your reaction succeeds any status effect it applied ceases to be.
- Reacting to being moved into danger. You challenge your opponent per the [challenge rules](#challenge-rules) and if you succeed you can reverse the situation or escape danger (or both depending on how your GM feels about the action.)
- Reacting to some challenge to save some of your Resolve or Power
  - Best example of this is reacting to a pitfall: you're still going to take some damage from the fall, but reacting to it may let you take half at your GM's discretion.

## Cleanse Actions

> **Game Master's Guide:** When a character uses a Cleanse action to remove a harmful effect, guide the roll appropriately. They'll roll against the AC of the effect's creator—use the stat tied to that character (Physical for an archer's arrow, Will for a mental assault, etc.). If they succeed, remove the status and celebrate their recovery. If they fail, the effect lingers and the battle continues against them. Cleanse actions represent the struggle to shake off wounds and ailments—make each attempt feel significant.

Cleanse actions are a special type of action. You get one free each turn, and after that may convert [full actions](#full-actions) into additional ones.

When you run a cleanse action you roll an appropriate skill against the ability that inflicted the effect on you (IE: if you have an arrow through the knee you would likely roll physical vs their acrobatics AC since their dexterity on placing the shot is what matters for if you can get it out and end the debiliating effect.)

When rolling a cleanse action that is not a challenge **you roll against your opponent's AC in that skill, not against an opponent's actual roll**. Target the one who created the status before you roll: that way your GM will know whether you defeated it (if you forgot to, the AC formula is 11 + stat + any AC specific bonuses your GM would know about)

## Challenge Rules

> **Game Master's Guide:** Challenges are the heart of defensive play—back-and-forth contests where opponents test each other's skill. When someone challenges an attack or effect, have them roll against the opponent's result. If they beat it, the opponent rolls to top them again. This continues until someone fails to beat the previous roll—and that's where the drama lives! Remember: challenges, while they may happen often, can really alter the flow of battle when they occur. Was someone saving a particularly nasty status effect for when a player / enemy's reactions are down? Choice of when to use it are important to keep in mind. This high-risk, high-reward mechanic keeps combat unpredictable and tactical. Facilitate these exchanges with energy—make each roll feel like a clash of will and skill!

One of the big points of a reaction or prepared action is that you are directly challenging the opponent. For instance, if you're reacting to a mind control spell, you would use your will after the spell's hit to attempt to shake off the effect right away rather than having to use a [cleanse action](#cleanse-actions) on your turn and risk them using you for dastardly purposes in the meantime.

### Reaction Challenges

You roll an appropriate dice (determined by your GM) against the effect you're trying to remove or splash back. You roll against the **first** hit if there's more than one. If you succeed, the opponent rolls the primary ability of that action (IE: a mage would roll will). The two of you keep going until one of you fails to 'top' the last roll.

#### If You Win

You immediately remove the effect that the attack placed on you. If you were trying to **splash back** the effect with something that could reasonably hit both you and them then the GM should roll damage against the opponent as if one of its damages hit them. The GM may choose to have more than one damage hit: that's up to them.

#### If They Win

Your reaction is consumed and you're left with the full effect.

### Prepared Challenges

You roll an appropriate dice (determined by the GM based on what you're doing) the opponent rolls the **primary dice** on the ability they'd like to use (IE: if its a spell its probably will). You continue to go back and forth until one of you rolls lower than the other.

### If You Win

An effect appropriate to what you lined up to do occurs. IE: if you threw a rock to interrupt a spell casting, they'd lose the action and they'd take d2 + d2 damage.

### If They Win

You lose your prepared action and you're left dealing with them taking the action you wanted to stop.

### Opponent Reactions to Prepared Actions

When your Prepared Action triggers and you win the challenge, interrupting the opponent's action, that opponent may choose to use their Reaction to counter your Prepared Action. This creates a back-and-forth contest similar to counterspelling:

- **If you win the initial challenge:** The opponent is interrupted and loses their action. They may now use their Reaction to challenge your Prepared Action (this is a NEW, separate challenge).
- **If the opponent wins their reaction challenge:** They overcome your interruption and proceed with their original action (though they've now spent their Reaction).
- **If you win the reaction challenge:** Your interruption stands—the opponent has lost both their action and their Reaction with no effect.

This creates dramatic moments where players must weigh the risk of their Prepared Action being countered by a desperate opponent.

> **In Practice:** Kaelen prepares to interrupt an archer's shot. When the trigger occurs, they engage in a challenge roll. Kaelen wins—the archer is interrupted and loses their action. The archer, desperate to avoid defeat, now uses their Reaction to challenge Kaelen's Prepared Action's effect. This is a new, separate challenge. If the archer wins this reaction challenge, their shot proceeds (though they've already spent their Reaction). If Kaelen wins again, the interruption stands—the archer has lost both their action and their Reaction with nothing to show for it.

## Criticals

> **Game Master's Guide:** When the dice land on a critical, Foundry flags it—but you decide what it means. Critical hits can grant bonus actions, allowing characters to seize the moment and turn the tide. Critical misses can cost actions, creating setbacks that heighten tension. You choose how these impact the action economy: grant extra turns on hits, deduct actions on misses, or keep things purely narrative. Whatever you decide, make it consistent and make it memorable. Criticals should feel special—whether through mechanical advantage or dramatic storytelling.

Criticals are still a thing in this system, but they impact things differently than you may be used to in that they impact the action economy, not the action in which they took place.

### Critical Hits

Critical hits provide you with an immediate bonus full action. If on your turn you may use it as normal, if on an enemy's turn their turn execution pauses and you may take your bonus full action before they act under the normal rules for full actions.

### Critical Misses

Critical misses cost you a full action. If you critical miss on your first action of a turn you cannot take your second action. if you critical miss on the second action of your turn you lose one of your full actions for the next turn. If you are [pushing](#pushing-rules) then as an additional punishment you lose both your next turn's full actions.

### An Important Note

Critical Hits and Critical Misses can ONLY occur on the first roll of an action chain. Though action cards may SAY "Critical Miss" or "Critical Hit" past that first one you should NOT count them for purposes of the action economy. This is to balance out multi-hit moves.

In addition, you may sometimes see "Stolen Crit" or "Saved Miss". These status messages indicate that disadvantage or advantage prevented the critical hit / miss. So they do NOT alter the action economy.

## Pushing Rules

> **Game Master's Guide:** A Push represents a character's desperate gamble to finish a foe—converting Move, Reaction, and Cleanse actions into one final, devastating Full Action. Track this sacrifice carefully: they cannot move, react, or cleanse during that turn. And the risk is real—if they critically miss while pushing, they lose both their Full Actions next turn! These all-or-nothing moments create the most dramatic combat scenes. When a player declares a Push, pause to acknowledge the stakes. When it pays off, celebrate their triumph. When it fails, make the consequences meaningful.

Do you think your opponent is about to be finished off? A push might be just the way to do it. The rules of a push are simple: you convert your move, your reaction, and your cleanse action into an additional full action for this turn. That means you **cannot** have attempted a cleanse this turn and you **cannot** move as part of this turn unless its part of a full action. You also lose your ability to react.

If you critically miss during a push you lose both your actions from the next turn. Critical hits are treated as normal and rewarded with an extra action.

## Some Important Design Notes

While there are flaws with this system things were designed this way intentionally. The following are idiosyncraties you might notice.

### Agile armor makes arrows harder to remove

This is, perhaps, the most odd rule of them all. If armor were to give an AC Only +1 to acrobatics it would mean that any attempts to remove arrows shot by that opponent would be 1 more difficult than normal. The reason this was chosen is because we wished to remove part of the luck factor from getting an effect removed: effects are meant to be slightly less likely to be removed since they're meant to represent you getting worn down in battle. The alternative, having it be a challenge roll, is something you may consider if you don't like the way this feels but keep in mind it means you'll have to deal with luck on BOTH sides being a factor.

### Critical cleanses can lead to extra actions

The intention here is that critical hits should feel nice to do no matter WHAT happened to cause them. The reason why we don't allow critical hits or misses on subsequent repetitions of an action is because we don't want to overly reward multi-hit moves since they're already extremely powerful and do not need the additional boost.

### The system can be quite bursty

This is intentional as well: combat is not meant to last forever and we would encourage rather than hard game overs to treat resolve out as a "defeat" that can usually be recovered from. This is not ALWAYS the case, if they're facing a being intent on eating the world and utterly fail the combat then the world's probably gonna get eaten, but not everything should be seeking the party's immediate demise. If you wish for less burst and longer combats? Cut the full actions per turn down to 1, just be aware that this makes critical hits and misses more powerful than they already are.
