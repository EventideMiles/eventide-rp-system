### Resources

Your character has two primary resources:

#### **Resolve**

- **What it is**: Your health, stamina, and general well-being
- **How it works**: Decreases when you take damage, increases when you rest or heal
- **Derived from**: Primarily your Fortitude ability
- **When it reaches 0**: Your character is incapacitated or worse (we encourage GMs to use this to suit your story)

#### **Power**

- **What it is**: Your capacity for special abilities, magic, and extraordinary feats
- **How it works**: Spent to use Combat Powers and special abilities
- **Derived from**: Primarily your Will ability
- **Regeneration**: Typically recovers during rest periods and by actively spending actions to restore it in combat

## Character Creation Process

### Step 1: Concept and Background

Before touching numbers, develop your character's identity:

#### Character Concept

- **Who are they?** (profession, background, personality)
- **What drives them?** (goals, motivations, fears)
- **How do they solve problems?** (violence, diplomacy, cunning, magic)
- **What makes them unique?** (quirks, flaws, special traits)

#### Background Questions

- Where did they grow up?
- What was their profession before adventuring?
- Do they have family or close relationships?
- What significant events shaped their life?
- Why are they adventuring now?

**Make sure to document this in the biography!**

### Step 2: Ability Scores

Work with your GM to determine your starting ability scores. Common methods include:

#### Point Buy System (Recommended)

- Start with all abilities at 1
- Distribute a pool of points (typically 15-20) among abilities
- Maximum starting ability is usually 5
- Consider your character concept when allocating points

#### Array System

- Choose from pre-made ability arrays
- Example arrays:
  - **Balanced**: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2
  - **Specialist**: 4, 3, 2, 2, 2
  - **Focused**: 5, 3, 2, 1, 1

#### Rolling

- Some GMs prefer random generation
- Roll dice as directed by your GM
- Assign results to abilities based on your concept

### Step 3: Calculate Derived Values

Once you have ability scores, calculate:

#### Resources

- **Resolve**: Usually Fortitude × 5 + base amount (varies by GM)
- **Power**: Usually Will × 3 + base amount (varies by GM)

#### Secondary Stats

- **Dice Pool**: Determines what die you roll (usually d20 to start)
- **Critical Range**: When you score critical successes (usually 20)
- **Fail Range**: When you score critical failures (usually 1)
- **Initiative**: How quickly you act in combat

_Note: Your GM will help calculate these values using values on features or statuses that only they have access to change_

### Step 4: Features and Traits

Features represent your character's background, training, and inherent abilities:

#### Types of Features

- **Background Features**: Represent your character's history and training
- **Racial/Species Features**: If your setting includes different species
- **Professional Features**: Related to your character's occupation or calling
- **Personal Features**: Unique traits that make your character special

#### Creating Features

Work with your GM to create features that:

- Reflect your character's background and concept
- Provide mechanical benefits that support your playstyle
- Add interesting roleplay opportunities
- Balance power with interesting limitations

#### Example Features

- **"Street Smart"**: +2 to Wits when dealing with urban environments
- **"Weapon Master"**: +1 to Physical when using your chosen weapon type
- **"Natural Leader"**: Allies gain +1 to rolls when you encourage them
- **"Magical Sensitivity"**: +1 to Will for spellcasting, -1 to Fort against magic

### Step 5: Starting Equipment

#### Basic Gear

Every character typically starts with:

- **Clothing** appropriate to their background
- **Basic tools** of their trade or profession
- **Simple weapons** if appropriate to their concept
- **A small amount of money** for additional purchases

#### Custom Gear

Work with your GM to create specialized equipment:

- Use the **Gear Creator** if your GM allows player access
- Ensure gear fits your character concept and the campaign setting
- Balance mechanical benefits with appropriate costs or limitations

#### Equipment Guidelines

- **Start simple**: Don't overload your character with complex gear initially
- **Match your concept**: A scholar might have books, a warrior might have armor
- **Consider utility**: Include items for non-combat situations
- **Leave room to grow**: Don't take the most powerful gear available

### Session Zero

Many groups hold a "Session Zero" before play begins:

- **Create characters together** as a group
- **Discuss party dynamics** and roles
- **Establish campaign expectations** and boundaries
- **Ensure character concepts work together**

## Example Character Creation

- **Wits**: 4 (brilliant scholar)

**Resources**:

- **Resolve**: 20 (3 Fort × 5 + 5 base)
- **Power**: 20 (5 Will × 3 + 5 base)

**Features**:

- **"Ancient Lore"**: +2 to Wits when dealing with historical or magical knowledge
- **"Magical Theory"**: +1 to Will when casting spells, but must speak incantations aloud
- **"Magical Training"**: This is more of a permanent increase to will and is put in as a feature to show your growth

**Starting Gear**:

## Next Steps

Once your character is created:

1. **Review the [Player Guide](README.md)** for gameplay mechanics
2. **Learn about [Combat](../system-features/combat.md)** if you expect action
3. **Understand [Status Effects](../system-features/status-effects.md)** and how they work
4. **Coordinate with your party** to ensure good group dynamics
5. **Start playing** and let your character grow through experience!

Remember: Character creation is just the beginning. The most interesting characters develop through play, relationships, and the challenges they face in the game world.
