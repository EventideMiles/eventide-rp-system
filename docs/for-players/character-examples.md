## Part 1: Sci-Fi Characters

### Example 1: Cyberpunk - Kaelen "Ghost" Varr

> *In the neon-lit sprawl of Neo-Veridia, reputation is everything. When the corps took everything from me, I learned that the only way to survive is to become the thing they fear.*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Kaelen "Ghost" Varr  
**Age:** 32  
**Profession:** Corporate Extraction Specialist / Freelance Saboteur

Kaelen was once a promising cybersecurity architect for Arasaka-Tech, a rising star with a bright future. That changed when he discovered evidence of illegal human experimentation hidden in the company's encrypted servers. Before he could expose them, a company hit team eliminated his family and branded him a terrorist. Now he operates in the shadows of the megacity, using his skills to dismantle corporate corruption one job at a time. He's driven by revenge, but also by a desperate need to protect others from suffering his fate.

**Motivation:** Burn Arasaka-Tech to the ground and expose their crimes to the world.  
**Playstyle:** Calculated, methodical, and ruthless when necessary. Kaelen prefers precision strikes over brute force, using stealth and intelligence to outmaneuver enemies.

#### Combat Powers

**1. Precision Strike (Basic Attack)**

- **Cost:** 1 Power
- **Range:** Melee or Ranged (depending on weapon)
- **Effect:** Make a Physical attack with your equipped weapon. On hit, deal weapon damage (d2+d2) plus any bonuses.
- **Description:** Kaelen strikes with calculated precision, whether wielding his mono-filament dagger or stunning baton. This is his go-to attack when conserving Power for more sophisticated tactics.

**2. Cyber-Surge**

- **Cost:** 3 Power
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Effect:** Make a Wits attack against the target's Will and Acrobatics AC. On either hit, the target suffers -2 to all ability scores for 2 rounds. If interrupted by a challenge, the effect is negated.
- **Description:** A focused data burst floods the target's neural interface with corrupt code, temporarily disrupting the integration between flesh and machine.

**3. Ghost Protocol**

- **Cost:** 3 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Become invisible to electronic sensors and cameras for 2 rounds. Gain advantage on all stealth rolls during this time.
- **Description:** Kaelen's neural interface generates a sophisticated electronic countermeasures field, bending light and scrambling sensors to render him virtually undetectable to machines—but not to living eyes.

**4. Quick Stabilization (Recovery - Resolve)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Recover 20 Resolve.
- **Description:** Using advanced medical nanites and combat experience, Kaelen quickly patches up wounds to keep fighting. "Not dead yet."

**5. Neural Recharge (Recovery - Power)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Recover 1 Power.
- **Description:** Kaelen runs a quick diagnostic and power cycle on his neural interface, refreshing his reserves for more complex operations.

**6. EMP Blast (Inventory-Based Attack)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power | **Consumes:** 1 EMP Grenade from inventory
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Effect:** Throw an EMP grenade in a 20ft radius. Make a Physical attack against each target's AC in the area. On hit, deal 2d2+2d2 damage and disable all electronic devices (weapons, cybernetics, drones, etc.) for 1 round. Affects allies too (use with caution).
- **Description:** Kaelen hurls an EMP grenade, creating a devastating electromagnetic pulse that damages enemies while scrambling their electronics. "Lights out!"
- **Inventory Note:** EMP Grenades can be purchased at tech vendors for 500 credits each, or crafted using rare components. Recovery between adventures requires time and money.

---

#### Playstyle Notes

Kaelen excels at **hit-and-run tactics**. His high Acrobatics and Wits make him deadly in urban environments, especially when he can use stealth to his advantage. In combat:

- **Baseline Rotation:** Use **Precision Strike** when you need to conserve Power. It's your reliable damage dealer that keeps you in the fight without draining your resources
- **Inventory Attacks:** When facing tough opponents, consider using **EMP Blast** to deal heavy area damage (2d2+2d2) and disable enemy electronics. This consumes an EMP Grenade, so save it for crucial moments against cybernetic foes
- **Recovery Management:** Use **Quick Stabilization** and **Neural Recharge** during downtime in combat—perfect for those rounds when you've spent a Full Action but have unused actions remaining
- **Opening Move:** Use **Ghost Protocol** to close distance undetected, then strike with the **Mono-filament Dagger** from stealth for maximum damage
- **Crowd Control:** When facing multiple enemies, use **System Override** to weaken cybernetic opponents, giving allies an edge
- **Emergency Response:** Activate **Cyber-Surge** when initiative is critical or when you need to make a difficult escape
- **Defense:** Kaelen's moderate Fortitude means he shouldn't draw prolonged attention. Use his mobility and the **Reactive Smart-Cloak** to stay elusive

**Weaknesses:** Heavy armor and fortitude-focused opponents can weather his attacks. EMP effects severely limit his capabilities. Kaelen struggles in wilderness or rural environments where his **Urban Shadow** feature provides no benefit.

**Strengths:** Electronic warfare, stealth, tactical planning, urban combat, disabling enemy technology.

### Example 2: Space Opera - Captain Zorg "Blasto" McGlory

> *They said the Star-Dasher was junk. They said my crew was a collection of misfits and rejects. Well, I've got news for them: misfits have nothing to lose, and junk doesn't look pretty when it explodes.*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Zorg "Blasto" McGlory  
**Age:** 27  
**Profession:** Freelance Space Captain / Professional Optimist

Zorg inherited the *Star-Dasher*—a battered, patchwork freighter—from his grandfather, a legendary spacer who allegedly once talked a black hole into spitting out a lost shipment. Despite the ship's constant mechanical issues and his crew's questionable qualifications, Zorg's unwavering positivity has carried them through impossible situations. He believes that every problem has a solution, usually involving explosives, creative interpretation of regulations, and a lot of improvisation.

**Motivation:** Pay off the Star-Dasher's massive repair debts while having the most legendary adventures the galaxy has ever seen.  
**Playstyle:** Chaotic good, enthusiastic, and wildly creative. Zorg solves problems with enthusiasm, improvisation, and the occasional well-placed explosion.

**Ability Total:** 16

---

- *Flavor:* "Watch as I spectacularly, gloriously, and recklessly save the day!"

---

#### Combat Powers

**1. Plasma Blast (Basic Attack)**

- **Cost:** 1 Power
- **Range:** Ranged (using Sparky)
- **Effect:** Make a Physical attack with your plasma rifle. On hit, deal weapon damage (d2+d2) plus any bonuses.
- **Description:** Zorg fires a steady shot from "Sparky"—not as flashy as an explosion, but reliable and efficient. Sometimes you just need to shoot something.

**2. Boom Time!**

- **Cost:** 2 Power
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Effect:** Create an explosion dealing 2d2 + 2d2 Physical damage in a 20ft radius. Make a Physical attack against each target's AC in the area.
- **Description:** Zorg reveals a hidden explosive device from somewhere on his person. "Trust me, this is exactly what the tactical situation calls for! Probably!"

**2. Emergency Repairs**

- **Cost:** 1 Power
- **Range:** Touch
- **Effect:** Restore 25 Resolve to a single target (self or ally) and remove one negative status effect. If used on a machine, it can also repair one broken mechanical function.
- **Description:** Duct tape, determination, and questionable engineering knowledge combine to patch up wounds and machines alike. "Good as new! Better, even! It's got... character now."

**3. Full Throttle!**

- **Cost:** 3 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Gain +3 to Physical and Acrobatics for 2 rounds. During this time, your attacks become reckless and gain +2 damage, but enemies gain advantage on attacks against you.
- **Description:** Zorg's confidence reaches dangerous levels. "Nothing can stop us now! Nothing! Except maybe physics, but we'll cross that bridge when we explode it!"

**4. Patch-Up Job (Recovery - Resolve)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Recover 20 Resolve.
- **Description:** Zorg applies field medicine using whatever's handy—bandages, tape, and pure determination. "That's gonna leave a scar. A cool scar!"

**5. Power Snack (Recovery - Power)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Recover 1 Power.
- **Description:** Zorg consumes one of the mysterious energy bars from his utility belt. He's not sure what flavor it is, but it works.

**6. Big Boom (Inventory-Based Attack)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power | **Consumes:** 1 Explosive Charge from inventory
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Effect:** Throw an explosive charge in a 15ft radius. Make a Physical attack against each target's AC in the area. On hit, deal 2d2+2d2 Physical damage. Targets in the area are pushed back 5 feet if they fail a Fortitude save (DC 15).
- **Description:** Zorg throws a properly prepared explosive—no improvising, just pure destruction. "Finally, something goes according to plan!"
- **Inventory Note:** Explosive Charges can be crafted using unstable chemicals and volatile materials (cost: 200 credits each). Recovery between adventures requires time and materials.

---

#### Playstyle Notes

Zorg is a **force of nature**—not subtle, not tactical, but incredibly effective through sheer enthusiasm and durability. He shines in chaotic situations where conventional approaches fail. In combat:

- **Baseline Rotation:** Use **Plasma Blast** as your bread-and-butter attack when Power is scarce. It keeps the pressure on without wasting your explosive abilities
- **Inventory Attacks:** When you need serious damage, throw an **Explosive Charge** as a **Big Boom** to deal 2d2+2d2 damage in an area. It also pushes enemies back! Save these for when enemies cluster—they're powerful but limited
- **Recovery Management:** **Emergency Repairs** provides healing and status removal, but **Patch-Up Job** and **Power Snack** are your zero-cost options for basic recovery between big moves
- **Opening Move:** Throw an **Explosive Charge** into the enemy formation, then charge in with **"Sparky"** blazing
- **Crowd Control:** Use **Boom Time!** when enemies cluster together. The collateral damage is... part of the charm
- **Support:** **Emergency Repairs** can keep allies fighting or fix critical equipment mid-combat
- **All-Out Assault:** Activate **Full Throttle!** when you need to finish a fight quickly or make a dramatic escape

**Weaknesses:** Zorg's low Wits means he struggles with complex puzzles or social manipulation. His reckless style can endanger allies. He's ineffective in situations requiring stealth or precise coordination.

**Strengths:** Durability, raw damage output, environmental improvisation, morale boosting, turning bad situations into... different bad situations (but more exciting ones!).

**Party Role:** The heart of the party, the damage dealer, and the guy who somehow survives situations that should have killed everyone three times over. Even when he fails, he fails spectacularly enough to become the story everyone tells later.

## Part 2: Fantasy Characters

### Example 3: Classic Fantasy - Serious Character - Sir Valerius "The Iron Wall" Blackwood

> *The darkness took my family, but it will not take my kingdom. I am the shield that stands between the innocent and the abyss. I will not break.*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Sir Valerius Blackwood
**Age:** 42
**Profession:** Knight Commander of the Order of the Silver Dawn

Sir Valerius has spent twenty years fighting the encroaching shadows that threaten the Kingdom of Aethelgard. Once a noble's son with a bright future, he watched his family slaughtered by a necromancer's horde during the Night of Black Tears. That night forged him into a weapon against darkness—he joined the Order of the Silver Dawn and rose through the ranks through sheer determination and an unyielding commitment to protecting the innocent. He carries the weight of every life he couldn't save, driving him to be better, stronger, and more vigilant.

**Motivation:** Destroy the necromancer who murdered his family and ensure no other kingdom suffers the same fate.
**Playstyle:** Stoic, protective, and methodical. Valerius is a frontline defender who puts himself between danger and those he protects.

---

#### Ability Scores

| Ability | Score | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Acrobatics (Acro)** | **2** | Heavy armor limits mobility, but years of training keep him capable |
| **Physical (Phys)** | **4** | Exceptional strength from decades of combat and training |
| **Fortitude (Fort)** | **4** | Nearly superhuman endurance; has survived wounds that would kill lesser men |
| **Will** | **4** | Unshakable resolve forged in tragedy and tempered by duty |
| **Wits** | **2** | Not the quickest thinker, but possesses battlefield wisdom |

**Ability Total:** 16

#### Resources

| Resource    | Value   | Calculation                       |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Resolve** | **140** | 100 + (10 × Fortitude 4) = 140    |
| **Power**   | **13**  | 5 + Will (4) + Fortitude (4) = 13 |

---

#### Derived Values

| Statistic           | Value    | Calculation                       |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Main Initiative** | **2**    | (Acro 2 + Wits 2) ÷ 2 = 2         |
| **Sub Initiative**  | **0.16** | Total abilities (16) ÷ 100 = 0.16 |

---

#### Features

**1. Unbreakable Oath**

- *Benefit:* +2 to Fortitude when protecting allies or defending a position
- *Bonus:* Once per day, can ignore a single effect that would reduce him to 0 Resolve
- *Flavor:* The sacred oath he swore upon his family's grave burns with divine light when tested

**2. Knight's Resilience**

- *Benefit:* Reduce all Physical damage taken by 5
- *Limitation:* Cannot move more than half speed while this benefit is active
- *Flavor:* Years of wearing heavy armor have conditioned his body to absorb punishment

**3. Aura of Protection**

- *Benefit:* Allies within 10 feet gain +1 to Fortitude and Will
- *Flavor:* His presence inspires courage and determination in those around him

**4. Veteran Tactician**

- *Benefit:* +2 to Wits when assessing enemy formations or identifying weaknesses
- *Flavor:* Two decades of warfare have taught him to read a battlefield like a scholar reads a book

---

**Balance Note**: Knight's Resilience is intentionally powerful, reflecting Valerius's role as an unstoppable defender. The +5 damage reduction makes him nearly unkillable, allowing players to experience the fantasy of being the party's "Iron Wall." The half-speed limitation encourages tactical positioning – choose when to plant your feet and become immovable, versus when mobility matters more.

---

#### Playstyle Notes

Valerius is a **defensive powerhouse**—the party's shield and anchor. His high Fortitude and defensive abilities make him nearly unkillable, while his features protect allies around him. In combat:

- **Baseline Rotation:** **Blade of Valor** is your reliable damage dealer—use it between big defensive moves to keep pressure on enemies without depleting your Power
- **Inventory Attacks:** When fighting undead or shadow creatures, throw a **Holy Water Flask** to deal 2d2+2d2 damage (+10 bonus vs undead) and frighten enemies. Save these for the toughest supernatural foes
- **Recovery Management:** **Divine Mend** and **Spiritual Focus** provide essential recovery during long fights. Valerius can sustain himself remarkably well by using these during rounds when positioning is more important than attacking
- **Opening Move:** Position yourself between enemies and vulnerable allies. Activate **Shield of the Dawn** to establish a defensive line
- **Crowd Control:** Use **Righteous Smite** on the most dangerous enemy to remove them from the fight temporarily
- **Emergency Response:** Save **Last Stand** for when the party is overwhelmed or when you need to protect allies at all costs
- **Defense:** Valerius's low Acrobatics means he won't win initiative races. Embrace this—let enemies come to you, then punish them for it

**Weaknesses:** Slow movement and low initiative mean Valerius can be outmaneuvered by fast enemies. His low Wits makes him vulnerable to clever tactics and magical manipulation. He struggles in situations requiring stealth or subtlety.

**Strengths:** Damage absorption, protecting allies, fighting undead and shadow creatures, enduring punishment, inspiring courage in others.

**Party Role:** The frontline defender, the party's anchor, and the one who ensures everyone makes it home alive.

### Example 4: Classic Fantasy - Fun Character - Fizzlewick "The Magnificent" Sparkletoes

> *Yes, I accidentally turned the mayor into a newt. But in my defense, he looked very newt-like, and I was trying to turn him into a badger. The spell was only off by one letter!*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Fizzlewick Sparkletoes
**Age:** 87 (young for a gnome)
**Profession:** Self-Proclaimed Archmage of Minor Inconveniences

Fizzlewick graduated from the prestigious Academy of Arcane Arts with the lowest passing grade in the institution's 400-year history. His professors described him as "enthusiastically incompetent" and "a danger to himself and everyone within a 50-foot radius." Undeterred, Fizzlewick set out to prove them all wrong by becoming the greatest wizard the world has ever seen. So far, he has accidentally summoned a cheese elemental, turned a tavern's beer into actual gold (making it undrinkable), and once cast a fireball that somehow made everyone in the room smell like lavender for a week. He remains optimistic.

**Motivation:** Prove his former professors wrong by accidentally saving the world through a series of fortunate mishaps.
**Playstyle:** Chaotic, enthusiastic, and surprisingly effective despite himself. Fizzlewick solves problems with magic, confidence, and a complete lack of understanding of consequences.

#### Features

**1. Magical Mishap**

- *Benefit:* When a spell fails or backfires, roll a d6. On a 5-6, the spell produces a beneficial effect instead of the intended one
- *Flavor:* The universe seems to have a sense of humor where Fizzlewick is concerned

**2. Gnome Ingenuity**

- *Benefit:* +2 to Wits when improvising solutions or jury-rigging magical devices
- *Bonus:* Can attempt to identify any magical item, even if he has no training
- *Flavor:* "I don't know what this ancient artifact does, but I'm going to poke it with this stick and find out!"

**3. Unintended Consequences**

- *Benefit:* Once per day, can cause a random magical effect in a 30-foot radius. Roll on the Wild Magic table (GM's discretion)
- *Flavor:* Fizzlewick's magic has a mind of its own, and it's very creative

**4. Arcane Confidence**

- *Benefit:* +1 to Will when attempting something he's never done before
- *Limitation:* Must announce his intention with dramatic flair
- *Flavor:* "Fear not, citizens! I, Fizzlewick the Magnificent, shall handle this with my signature spell: The Thing I Just Made Up!"

---

**Balance Note**: Fireball-ish may appear power-efficient at 30 damage for 2 Power, but its 25% random damage type change (ice, lightning, or confetti) makes it unpredictable. This unpredictability is thematic – Fizzlewick's magic is chaotic, and sometimes you get devastating flames, sometimes you get confetti. The spell's efficiency is balanced by the risk that you'll cast something less effective in the heat of battle, creating memorable moments of magical mayhem.

#### Combat Powers

**1. Magic Missile-ish (Basic Attack)**

- **Cost:** 1 Power
- **Range:** 30 feet

- **Description:** Fizzlewick launches a concentrated bolt of magical energy. "Behold my might—wait, was that a toad? A toad just hit you in the face!"

**2. Fireball-ish**

- **Cost:** 2 Power
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Effect:** Make a Wits attack against each target's AC in a 20-foot radius. On hit, deal 30 damage. There's a 25% chance the fireball is a different color and deals a random damage type (ice, lightning, or confetti).

**2. Shield of Sorts**

- **Cost:** 1 Power

**3. Wild Surge**

- **Cost:** 3 Power

**4. Magical Bandage (Recovery - Resolve)**

- **Cost:** 0 Power
- **Range:** Self
- **Effect:** Recover 20 Resolve.

- **Effect:** Fizzlewick hurls a handful of random spell components at a target. Make a Wits attack against their AC. On hit, deal 2d2+2d2 damage of a random type (Physical, elemental, psychic, or arcane). There's a 25% chance the effect changes to something harmless but entertaining instead.
- **Description:** A desperate Fizzlewick throws magical components at enemies hoping something magical happens. "Eat this! Wait, that was sulfur. Did I just feed them sulfur? It worked!"
- **Inventory Note:** Spell Components can be gathered from magical creatures or purchased at arcane shops (cost: 25 gold per pouch). Recovery between adventures requires foraging or purchasing.

---

#### Playstyle Notes

Fizzlewick is a **wild card**—unpredictable, entertaining, and somehow effective despite his incompetence. His high Acrobatics and Wits make him surprisingly survivable, and his features can turn disasters into advantages. In combat:

- **Baseline Rotation:** Use **Magic Missile-ish** when you need consistent damage without spending Power. It's your most reliable spell—assuming it doesn't turn into a toad
- **Inventory Attacks:** When you need serious damage, throw a **Component Blast** to deal 2d2+2d2 damage of a random type. It's unpredictable but powerful—save your spell components for tough fights
- **Recovery Management:** **Magical Bandage** and **Mana Munchies** are your lifelines. Use them when you're low on resources, but be prepared for amusing side effects
- **Opening Move:** Cast **Fireball-ish** into the enemy group and hope for the best. The randomness is part of the strategy
- **Defense:** Use **Shield of Sorts** on yourself or allies when things get dangerous. Even if it's ridiculous, it works
- **Emergency Response:** **Wild Surge** when you're desperate. The worst that can happen is... well, a lot of things, but at least it'll be memorable
- **Mobility:** Fizzlewick's high Acrobatics means he can dodge attacks and reposition easily. Use this to stay out of melee range

**Weaknesses:** Extremely low Physical means Fizzlewick is useless in melee combat. His spells are unreliable, and he can accidentally hinder allies. He's vulnerable to anti-magic effects and enemies who can exploit his chaotic nature.

**Strengths:** Unpredictability, crowd control (accidental or intentional), mobility, creative problem-solving, making every session memorable.

**Party Role:** The wild card, the comic relief, and the wizard who somehow saves the day through a combination of luck, confidence, and the universe's sense of humor.

## Part 3: Urban Fantasy Characters

### Example 5: Urban Fantasy - Serious Character - Detective Sarah Chen

> *The city thinks magic is a myth. They think the monsters in the shadows are just gangbangers and junkies. I know better. I've seen what's really out there, and I'm the only thing standing between this city and the abyss.*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Detective Sarah Chen
**Age:** 34
**Profession:** Homicide Detective / Supernatural Investigator

Sarah Chen was a rising star in the NYPD until the night she responded to a call in an abandoned warehouse and found something that shouldn't exist—a creature feeding on human victims, its skin shifting between forms. She survived the encounter, but her worldview didn't. Since then, she's operated as a one-woman supernatural task force, solving cases that other detectives can't or won't touch. She's seen vampires running blood donation centers, werewolves controlling construction unions, and demons working as corporate lawyers. The department thinks she's obsessed with the occult; the truth is, she's the only one paying attention.

**Motivation:** Protect the innocent from supernatural threats and expose the hidden world that preys on humanity.
**Playstyle:** Gritty, determined, and methodical. Sarah combines police training with supernatural knowledge to hunt monsters in the concrete jungle.

### Example 6: Urban Fantasy - Fun Character - Marcus "DJ Void" Rodriguez

> *The bass drops, the crowd goes wild, and somewhere in the back, a vampire realizes his drink has been replaced with tomato juice. That's not a mistake—that's art.*

#### Character Background

**Name:** Marcus "DJ Void" Rodriguez
**Age:** 28
**Profession:** Club DJ / Supernatural Prankster

Marcus Rodriguez was just another struggling DJ in New York City until the night he accidentally mixed a track that opened a portal to the fey realm. Instead of being eaten, he impressed the fey lord enough to be gifted with minor magical abilities—and a permanent invitation to the wildest supernatural parties in existence. Now he runs "The Void," an underground club that's neutral ground for supernatural beings of all types. He uses his magic to keep the peace, usually by embarrassing anyone who starts trouble. His philosophy: if you can't beat the supernatural, you might as well party with them.

**Motivation:** Keep his club safe, throw the best parties in the multiverse, and pull the ultimate prank on the vampire who tried to shut him down.
**Playstyle:** Charismatic, mischievous, and surprisingly effective. Marcus uses magic, music, and social manipulation to solve problems.

- **Inventory Note:** Glitter Bombs can be crafted with fey dust and prismatic powder (cost: 75 credits per bomb). Recovery between adventures requires visiting fey markets or crafting with rare materials.

---

#### Playstyle Notes

Marcus is a **support specialist**—controlling the battlefield through magic, music, and social manipulation. His high Wits and social features make him excellent at avoiding fights and resolving conflicts creatively. In combat:

- **Baseline Rotation:** **Sonic Pulse** provides consistent damage and positioning control without draining Power. Use it to disrupt enemy formations and protect allies
- **Inventory Attacks:** When you need area control and heavy damage, throw a **Fabulous Explosion** to deal 2d2+2d2 damage and cover enemies in glitter, debuffing their Wits and Acrobatics. These glitter bombs are limited, so save them for when enemies cluster together
- **Recovery Management:** **Party Recovery** and **Energy Boost** keep Marcus in the rhythm. Use them when the tempo slows or when you're setting up your next big musical number
- **Opening Move:** Use **Enchanted Beat** to buff allies or debuff enemies, setting up the battlefield
- **Crowd Control:** **Bass Drop** can push enemies away from vulnerable allies or create space
- **Disruption:** **Supernatural Remix** can remove powerful enemies from the fight temporarily, often with hilarious results
- **Social Situations:** Marcus shines outside combat, using his features to negotiate, gather information, and throw legendary parties

**Weaknesses:** Marcus is not a frontline fighter; his Physical is average, and he lacks heavy damage output. His magic is sound-based, so deaf enemies or soundproof environments limit his effectiveness. His party animal feature can backfire if he's hungover during a crisis.

**Strengths:** Social manipulation, crowd control, supporting allies, gathering information, supernatural networking, creative problem-solving.

**Party Role:** The face, the support specialist, and the guy who ensures that even in the darkest supernatural investigations, there's time for a good party.

## Character Example Notes

These characters are designed to be **balanced and playable** right out of the box, but they also demonstrate how the Eventide RP System can accommodate vastly different playstyles:

- **Kaelen** represents the **specialized, tactical approach**—a character who excels through careful planning and precise execution
- **Zorg** represents the **generalist, chaotic approach**—a character who succeeds through durability, adaptability, and sheer force of personality
- **Valerius** represents the **defensive anchor**—a character who protects allies through heavy armor and unyielding resolve
- **Fizzlewick** represents the **wild card**—a character whose unpredictability is both his greatest weakness and his greatest strength
- **Sarah** represents the **tactical specialist**—a character who combines methodical planning with supernatural knowledge
- **Marcus** represents the **creative support**—a character who uses unconventional methods to control the battlefield and uplift allies

All characters follow the core mechanics while showcasing the system's flexibility for different genres and tones across sci-fi, fantasy, and urban fantasy settings. Each character includes:

- A **basic attack** (1 Power) for reliable damage rotation using d2+d2 damage plus weapon bonuses
- An **inventory-based attack** (0 Power, consumes item) for high damage output (2d2+2d2) when you're willing to spend limited resources
- Two **recovery abilities** (0 Power each) to recover 20 Resolve and 1 Power respectively
- Thematic **special powers** that showcase their unique playstyle

**Inventory-Based Attacks Explained:** Unlike Power-based abilities, inventory-based attacks consume physical items from your gear. These deal significantly more damage (2d2+2d2 vs d2+d2 for basic attacks) but are limited by the number of items you possess. They cannot be used during combat if you've run out of that item. Recovery requires time and money between adventures—visiting shops, crafting materials, or finding rare components. This creates a strategic choice: conserve your powerful consumables for critical moments, or use them freely and face the economic consequences afterward.

**Important:** Every character in the Eventide RP System should have these baseline abilities to ensure they remain effective even when running low on Power. These recovery options are built into the action economy—any unused Full Action, or Move Action can be converted into recovery of 20 HP or 1 Power, but the dedicated recovery abilities (Quick Stabilization, Neural Recharge, etc.) provide the same effect without consuming your limited action conversion options. Its also notable that these recovery options usually cannot be used while you're out of resolve.
