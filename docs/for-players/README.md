# Eventide RP System Guide for Players

This guide will help players understand how to create and play characters in the Eventide Roleplaying System.

## Creating Your Character

### Character Sheet Basics

The Eventide character sheet is organized into several tabs that help you manage different aspects of your character:

1. **Main Tab**: Core abilities and character features
2. **Combat Powers**: Access and manage your character's special combat abilities
3. **Description**: A place for your character's background and story
4. **Status Effects**: Track temporary conditions affecting your character
5. **Gear**: Manage your gear and equipment

### Core Abilities

Your character has five core abilities that define their capabilities:

- **Acrobatics**: Agility, reflexes, and movement skills
- **Physical**: Raw strength, endurance, and physical prowess
- **Fortitude**: Constitution, resilience, and ability to withstand hardship: resolve typically comes from high fort
- **Will**: Mental strength, determination, and force of personality: spellcasting prowess
- **Wits**: Intelligence, perception, and quick thinking

These abilities form the foundation of your character and are used for most checks and actions in the game.

## Managing Your Equipment

### Gear System

Eventide features a robust equipment system that allows for detailed management of your character's possessions:

1. **Equipping Items**:
   - Items can be equipped/unequipped directly from item sheets or character sheets
   - Equipped status determines whether an item's bonuses are active
   - Some gear may require specific conditions to equip/unequip:
      - This can be used to create an item with a number of 'charges' every day. Once the charges are out it is not equipped and cannot be used until the next reset period
      - Cursed items exist that cannot be unequipped without the GM's help

2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Equipped items are displayed separately from unequipped items
   - Each item can have detailed descriptions and effects
   - Some items may have limited uses or charges

3. **Item Effects**:
   - Gear can modify your abilities while equipped
   - Some items may provide access to special powers
   - Cursed items exist that cannot be unequipped without special help

### Using The Gear Creator

If your GM has provided access to the player version of the Gear Creator macro:

1. Use it to easily create new gear
2. Follow your GM's guidelines for creating custom items - work together to create items that fit your character and their world

## Status Effects

Status effects represent temporary conditions affecting your character:

1. **Viewing Active Effects**:
   - Active status effects appear in the Status Effects tab
   - Clicking an effect displays its details without re-rolling it to chat
   - Effects may show icons on your token as visual reminders

2. **Effect Duration**:
   - All effects last until your GM is ready to remove them: while you can remove them yourself you should consult your GM before doing so

3. **Effect Modifications**:
   - Status effects can modify your abilities positively or negatively
   - Some may provide access to increased power
   - Others might restrict certain actions: hard to hit when you're rolling at disadvantage because you're under the effects of a status that makes you clumsy

## Using Combat Powers

Combat powers are special abilities your character can use during encounters:

1. **Activating Powers**:
   - Powers can be activated from your character sheet
   - Some powers have prerequisites or resource costs
   - The system provides reminders about requirements

2. **Power Effects**:
   - Powers may deal damage, apply status effects, or provide other benefits
   - Effects are automatically formatted in chat for everyone to see
   - Some powers may have limited uses between rests
   - You can use the description's rich text field to link to things that happen when you use an ability or to otherwise denote rolls as with any other foundry rich text field

## Rolling Abilities

There are multiple ways to make ability checks in Eventide:

1. **From Character Sheet**:
   - Click directly on abilities in your character sheet
   - Modifiers from equipment and status effects are automatically applied
   - Results are formatted and posted to chat

2. **Using Macros**:
   - The system includes macros for common roll types
   - Ask your GM about available macros for specific situations

## Customizing Your Experience

### UI Theme Options

The Eventide system offers theme customization to suit your preferences:

- Choose between Dark (default) and Light themes
- Configure your interface in the system settings

### Sound Settings

You can personalize sound feedback for various actions:

- Enable or disable system sounds
- Adjust volume settings
- Ask your GM about customizing specific sound effects
