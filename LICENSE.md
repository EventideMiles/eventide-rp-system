Copyright (c) 2024 Dalton Sterritt

## BOILERPLATE LICENSES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This system was started on the back of the Boilerplate system and though it
has grown a lot since then I could not have gotten as far as I have without
their code. Their code: https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate

## LICENSING RATIONALE

The LGPL 2.1+ license was chosen to:

3. **Encourage contributions** - Improvements to the core system benefit the entire community
4. **Enable commercial use** - Both the core system and extensions can be used commercially
5. **Maintain compatibility** - All included assets are compatible with LGPL licensing

## Additional Licensing Provisions:

### Author's Discretionary Licensing
